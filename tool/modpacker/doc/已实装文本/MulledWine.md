        `You savor this cup of mulled wine carefully, as it seems to have been infused with some obscure ingredients as flavorings. <br>
        However, this has made the taste of this red wine more rich and layered. <br>
        The sweet and rich fruit aroma blends harmoniously with a hint of sourness and a lingering wine-like flavor between the lips and teeth, <br>
        smoothly sliding down the throat and creating a warm sensation. <br>
        Even more delightful is the introduction of a light mist-like, semi-transparent solid that offers a completely new texture.<br>
        Perhaps you can ask the bartender what this is. You chew on the soft, translucent solid and think about it. <br>
        You feel a surge of heat throughout your body.`


        `你细细品尝着这杯热红酒，里面似乎加入了一些你不甚明晰的材料作为调味品。但这让这杯红酒的口感层次变得更加丰富了。
        香甜豐潤的果香和微微的酸澀後調與唇齒間回味的酒香巧妙地融合，順著食道滑入胃裡、升騰起一陣暖意。
        更妙的是還有輕霧狀的半透明固體帶來了全新的食感。
        也许你可以去问问调酒师这是什么。你咀嚼着弹软的半透明固体，这样想到。
        你感到渾身熱了起來。`
