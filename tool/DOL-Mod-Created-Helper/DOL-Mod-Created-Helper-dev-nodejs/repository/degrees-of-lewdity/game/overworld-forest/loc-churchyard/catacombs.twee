You are in the catacombs beneath the forest. A staircase leads upwards, to the churchyard. A statue of a six-armed angel smiles down at you, cradling a lit brazier in its lowest hands.

	A small statuette sits on the statue's shoulder. You could reach it.

You turn your back to the statue, and hold your bindings over the flame. The heat builds, and you feel a sting. You're about to pull away when the bindings burn loose. You tear yourself free.

:: Catacombs Statuette
<<effects>>

You climb the six-armed statue, standing on its arms and using the wings for support. It proves sturdy, and you come face-to-face with the statuette. It's a miniature version of the larger angel, except the arms and head are raised in supplication, and the smile beams.
<br><br>

You take the smaller angel from the larger angel's hand, and climb back down. It belongs in a museum.

You coo up at the stalactites, your voice soft. Only a faint echo answers at first,

	but then an orb of light descends. It hovers for a moment in front of you, before floating along the edge of the chasm.

	It arrives at the wall, illuminating a thin passage, and hovers there a moment, as if beckoning. Then it floats inside. It looks like a hidden passage around the chasm.
<<elseif $monster is 1>>
	but then a head pokes into view, followed by eight limbs. It's a <<beasttype>>, but there's no menace in <<bhis>> demeanor. <<bHe>> crawls down the stalactite, dropping the rest of the way on a silken thread, and lands in front of you.
	<br><br>

	"Dangerous place for you," <<bhe>> says. "I can carry you across the chasm if you like. I'm stronger than I look. Much stronger."

	You follow the light. It leads you through a maze of tight corridors in the stone, until you emerge in another part of the catacombs, on the other side of the chasm. Strange holes are bored in the walls and floor. The passage behind you has vanished in the dark.
	<br><br>

	With a playful sparkle, the light shoots towards the ceiling, and takes cover in a borehole.
<<elseif $monster is 1>>
	The <<beasttype>> rushes in circles around you. Before you can react, <<bhe>>'s wrapped several strands of thread around your waist. <<bHe>> climbs the thread <<bhe>> descended on, pulling you off your feet and into the air. "Best way to carry you," <<bhe>> says with an apologetic smile.
	<br><br>

	<<bHe>> crawls right up to the ceiling, and dashes over the chasm. You dangle beneath <<bhim>>, aware of the abyss beneath, until you reach the other side. <<bHe>> lowers you, gently, then descends <<bhimself>> and tears off the strands around your waist.
	<br><br>

	"See?" <<bHe>> grins. "Strong!" With a leap, <<bhe>> climbs the wall and vanishes into the dark once more. You're in another part of the catacombs. Strange boreholes fill the walls and floor.
<<else>>
	You climb onto the <<beasttype>>'s abdomen, and wrap your arms around <<bhis>> pedicel as <<bhe>> lurches into motion. <<bHe>> skitters up the strand of silk, and onto a horizontal web you could not see from below. <<bHe>> runs across a near-invisible network hung across the chasm. You cling tight, aware of the abyss beneath you.
	<br><br>

	<<bHe>> reaches the other side, and skitters down another strand. You climb down, and at once the spider launches itself onto the hanging strand, and vanishes into the dark. You're in another part of the catacombs. Strange boreholes fill the walls and floor.

Foot by foot, you lower yourself into the chasm, testing each step before committing. The shattered masonry and natural stone proves sturdy, and reaching the bottom isn't difficult.

You examine the crown. There are sockets on the front that were once filled, and the metal is corroded by time, but it's otherwise intact. It belongs in a museum.

	<br><br>

	It arrives at the wall, illuminating a thin passage, and hovers there a moment, as if beckoning. Then it floats inside. It looks like a hidden passage around the chasm.
<<elseif $monster is 1>>
	but then a head pokes into view, followed by eight limbs. It's a <<beasttype>>, but there's no menace in <<bhis>> demeanor. <<bHe>> crawls from the hole and down the wall, aided by a silken thread, and lands in front of you.
	<br><br>

	"Not friends with other humans," <<bhe>> asks. "I can carry you across the chasm if you like. Nearer exit. I'm stronger than I look. Much stronger."

	but then eight legs crawl into view. It's a giant <<beasttype>>, but there's no menace in <<bhis>> demeanor. <<bHe>> crawls from the hole and down the wall, aided by a silken thread, and lands in front of you.

	<<bHe>> turns and steps towards the chasm, lowering <<bhis>> abdomen. <<bHe>> wants to carry you over.

	You follow the light. It leads you through a maze of tight corridors in the stone, until you emerge in another part of the catacombs, on the other side of the chasm. Stalactites hang from the dark. The passage behind you has vanished in the shadows.
	<br><br>

	With a playful sparkle, the light shoots towards the ceiling, and takes cover among the stalactites.
<<elseif $monster is 1>>
	The <<beasttype>> rushes in circles around you. Before you can react, <<bhe>>'s wrapped several strands of thread around your waist. <<bHe>> climbs the thread <<bhe>> descended on, pulling you off your feet and into the air. "Best way to carry you," <<bhe>> says with an apologetic smile.
	<br><br>

	<<bHe>> crawls right up to the ceiling, and dashes over the chasm. You dangle beneath <<bhim>>, aware of the abyss beneath, until you reach the other side. <<bHe>> lowers you, gently, then descends <<bhimself>> and tears off the strands around your waist.
	<br><br>

	"See?" <<bHe>> grins. "Strong!" With a leap, <<bhe>> climbs the wall and vanishes into the dark once more. You're in another part of the catacombs. Stalactites hang from the dark.
<<else>>
	You climb onto the <<beasttype>>'s abdomen, and wrap your arms around <<bhis>> pedicel as <<bhe>> lurches into motion. <<bHe>> skitters up the strand of silk, and onto a horizontal web you could not see from below. <<bHe>> runs across a near-invisible network hung across the chasm. You cling tight, aware of the abyss beneath you.
	<br><br>

	<<bHe>> reaches the other side, and skitters down another strand. You climb down, and at once the spider launches itself onto the hanging strand, and vanishes into the dark. You're in another part of the catacombs. Stalactites hang from the dark.
