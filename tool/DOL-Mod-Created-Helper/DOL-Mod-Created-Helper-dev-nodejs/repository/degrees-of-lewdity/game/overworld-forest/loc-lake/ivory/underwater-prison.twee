You place your hand against the rune. You trace a symbol around it with your other hand, and it flashes to life with a red glow.
<br><br>
The walls rumble. Plumes of purple steam hiss as seams appear between the stone. Masses of lichen crumble and float away.
The wall around the rune begins to retract backwards, before falling into the floor. You swim into the breach.
<br><br>
Before you is a staircase leading up into darkness. Small patches of lichen illuminate sections of the wall. At the top, you can see a faint glow. You clumsily pull yourself along the walls leading up.

You hear the scraping of stone behind you as you climb. After some time, you fall forwards, landing on your hands. <span class="blue">You've left the water.</span> There's a large air pocket here, and the air is filled with a purple mist. You crawl up the last of the stairs.
<br><br>
<<if $wraithPrison>>
	You're back in the underwater prison.
<<else>>
	As you reach the top, you see the source of the glow. You're in a massive stone room lit by a colossal colony of glowing purple lichen. It snakes along the walls, occasionally following the pattern of intricate carvings.
	All around you are sets of large cages, many of which have rusted away. You spot a set of shackles in one of them. Another one of the cages seems to be the epicentre of the lichen colony, with much of it completely covered.
	<br><br>

You double over in pain. A pale, translucent limb emerges from your chest, followed by another. You're forcefully pushed into leaning backwards as it leaves you. <<pain 10>><<ggpain>>

You collapse on the cold stone floor, with your senses slowly returning to you. You retch, coughing up water. You sharply inhale, and taste a sickening sweetness in the air. <<hallucinogen 40>><<gghallucinogens>>

		It gently puts its hands on your neck, and pushes you down on your back. It floats down, coming to rest as it straddles you.

		It's naked, save for a necklace of ivory around its neck, set with large blue gemstones. It regards you with curious blue eyes, lifting your chin with its hand. It feels cold.

You expected your hands to be cold, but they're comfortably warm. A lewd feeling builds within you at its touch. You have no control over your body, but you can feel everything like normal.

As it begins to fondle your body, a wide grin forces itself across your face, and a dark pit settles in your stomach.

	<br><br>

	It lasts for a minute. Then two minutes. Three. You can't count how long it's been, but your grasp of time is just barely enough to register that it <span class="lewd">feels like forever</span>.
