:: Tentacle World Intro
<<location "tentworld">><<effects>><<set $phase to 0>>
<<tentacleworldintro>>

You open the door, revealing an alien landscape. Giant tentacles writhe against the sky. <span class="red">An orgasm here could be dangerous.</span>
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Tentacle Plains]]>><<set $tentacleEntrance to "asylum">><</link>>
<br>

:: Passout Tentacle World
<<location "tentworld">><<effects>>
<<strip>>
You wake, realising with horror that you are trapped naked within a mass of tentacles. They hold you several feet above the ground, your limbs
and torso secure in their gentle but unyielding embrace. Struggling to escape, you move your arms and legs in hopes of disrupting the tentacles'
grip. You fail, as every movement is countered effortlessly by the unconcerned appendages. Your desperation rises as your thrashing has no effect.
<br><br>

But desperation is not the only thing to rise. As you continue to breathe in the musky air and feel your captor's wriggling flesh pressing
against your arms and hips and calves, you find your body flush with growing arousal. Your genitals react. Sweat breaks out across your
skin. Your <<nipples>> harden. Unsatisfied by your previous climaxes, your body yearns to be touched. To be toyed with. To be pleasured.
<br><br>

And yet your <<genitals_are 1>> not assaulted. Your ass remains unmolested. Instead, the tentacles seem only interested in holding you in this
bondage. It's maddening, the pleasure rising within you like the tide. Though you wish to be free, your body wants to be used. Closing your
eyes, you moan with frustrated lust even as you ponder escape.
<br><br>

That sound spurs the tentacles into movement. Several begin to caress your chest and back, thighs and tummy. Far from your most sensitive
areas, they nevertheless drive you wild as you find yourself bucking against them. You ache with arousal, your mind drifting in a sea of desire.
<br><br>

It's too much. Though unable to get yourself off, or perhaps because of it, you find your body tingling as your climax begins to build.
You moan as the tentacles increase their speed, the dam within you breaking. It is slow, the pleasure building upon itself as the orgasmic
energy pours into your pelvis and you suck in deep ragged breaths. It's too much.
<br><br>

You cum, twitching against your captor as you groan through your climax. It lasts for many seconds, the tentacles gliding over your flesh
as the pleasure pulses brighter and brighter within you. Your stiff body collapses and you let out a long exhausted exhale.
<<orgasmstat>><<orgasmcount 1>>
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Passout Tentacle World 2]]>><</link>>
<br>

:: Passout Tentacle World 2
<<location "tentworld">><<effects>>

But it's not over. Before you can regain your senses, two naughty tentacles find your <<nipples>> and begin to vigorously grind against them.
You squeal at this spike of pleasure, your eyes flying open as you look down at your chest. Instead of feeling your orgasm dissipate, it
seems that this new assault has created an echo chamber within your nervous system and you realise with horror and anticipation that a new
climax is beginning to build within you.
<br><br>

Before it peaks, however, a third tentacle slides between your bottom and rubs aggressively over your hole, eliciting an even louder squeal
from you as the pleasure in your <<nipples>> and asshole merge into a tsunami that crashes against you. Your climax speeds towards you and you
open your mouth to scream.
<br><br>

Instead you cry out as the tentacles force you to cum hard. You buck and writhe against your bindings. Your eyes flutter open and closed.
Moans escape your throat as you endure the orgasm, the time growing indistinct as you cum and cum and cum.
<<orgasmstat>><<orgasmcount 1>>
<br><br>

Eventually, the powerful feelings start to fade. Despite the tentacles still teasing your body, you feel the effects of this newest climax
receding. Your mind, soaked for so long in a fog of unrelenting pleasure, starts to clear.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Passout Tentacle World 3]]>><</link>>
<br>

:: Passout Tentacle World 3
<<location "tentworld">><<effects>>

Then a tentacle flicks the tip of your <<print ($player.penisExist ? "penis" : "clit")>> hard, sending a jolt right to your brain. With
tentacles torturing your ass and nipples, this lone strike against your most sensitive place, which up until now had not been subjected
to any sensations, overloads your system. You cum suddenly, your body unprepared for the unstoppable pleasure. The explosion within you
causes your body to spasm, your hands clenched tight and your feet kicking out spastically.
<<orgasmstat>><<orgasmcount 1>>
<br><br>

Before this newest climax can properly fade, your <<genitals_are 1>> subjected to another hard slap that sends you spiralling into a fourth
orgasm. You scream as the tingling breaks down your mental barriers.
<<orgasmstat>><<orgasmcount 1>>
<br><br>

Another slap.
<<set $arousal to 10000>><<orgasm>>

Another.
<<set $arousal to 10000>><<orgasm>>

It goes on and on and on, your body no longer distinguishing one peak from the next. Your breathing ragged, your body fights the losing
battle against the pleasure being forced upon you and your mind begins to shatter.
<br><br>

Overwhelmed with unending orgasms, you eventually crash into unconsciousness.
