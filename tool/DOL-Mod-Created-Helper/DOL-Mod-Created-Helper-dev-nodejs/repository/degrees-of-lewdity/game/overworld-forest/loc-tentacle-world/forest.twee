:: Tentacle Forest Prison
<<set $bus to "tentacle_forest_prison">><<effects>>

The door unlocks with a click. You pull it open, and brace to stop the sour wind from knocking you over.
<br><br>

You enter the tunnel, bathed in purple light. Other corridors lead away from this one, their walls etched with strange symbols.

:: Tentacle Forest Quinn
<<effects>>

The door unlocks with a click. You pull it open, and a sour wind throws it the rest of the way, knocking you to the ground.
<br><br>

Inside is a tunnel, bathed in a dim purple light. You see movement in the distance, but it's too far to make out.
<br><br>

You enter, passing corridors leading away from the main tunnel, but the movement in the distance beckons you on.

:: Tentacle Forest Quinn 2
<<effects>>
<<set $hookah_plot to 1>>
<<set $hookah_state to 2>>
<<hookah_init>>
<<npc Quinn>><<person1>>
You draw close enough to make out a writhing mass. There's a figure in the centre. They hang limp, suspended by violating tentacles. One curls around their head, covering their eyes. Yet you can tell who it is. <span class="pink">It's Quinn, the mayor.</span><<gggawareness>><<awareness 24>>
<br><br>

You hear a thud, then a shattering of glass. You can't pinpoint the source. "This tresspass," echoes a disembodied voice. "Will have consequences." The walls vanish brick by brick as the voice reverberates down the tunnel.
<br><br>

<span class="blue">You glimpse an expanse behind the wall.</span> <span class="pink">Your mind rejects it,</span> and reality unravels to escape it.

:: Tentacle Forest Quinn 3
<<location "flats">><<set $outside to 0>><<effects>>

<<storeon "hookah">>
<<loadNPC 0 "hookah">><<person1>>

You awaken in the hookah parlour. You're alone. The hookah itself lies in pieces. The door has been broken off its hinges.
<br><br>

Lying in the entrance are a pair of tiny spectacles. A piece of paper is wrapped around the left temple. You unfurl it. There's writing, hastily scrawled.
<br><br>

"I've searched for so long. <span class="green">The glasses, and the parlour, are yours.</span> Thank you."

<br>

:: Tentacle Forest Quinn 4
<<effects>>

Even in its ransacked state, the parlour looks like it was once a normal flat. There's a kitchen with a working fridge. You open it. There are five cages inside. <span class="pink">A strange creature writhes within the lowest.</span>
<br><br>
You look through the rest of the parlour. There's no bed anywhere, and cleaning will take a lot of work.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Flats Hookah]]>><<endevent>><</link>>
<br>

:: Tentacle Forest Chest
<<effects>>

Seized by a bizarre competitiveness, you wrestle one of the tentacles to the ground. You toss to and fro,
<<set _rng to random(1, 2)>>
<<if _rng is 1>>
    until you manage to pin it beneath your weight.
    <br><br>
    You luxuriate in victory.<<gchestskill>><<chestskill 1>>

    until it hurls you aside.
    <br><br>

<</if>>

:: Tentacle Forest Bottom
<<effects>>

You sit on one of the pads, dipping your feet in the water. You find you can propel yourself by shifting your weight back and forth.
<<set _rng to random(1, 2)>>
<<if _rng is 1>>
    You can't travel far, but moving in a little circle proves relaxing.<<gbottomskill>><<bottomskill 1>>
    <br><br>
    <<destination_tentacle_forest>>
<<else>>
    You tumble into the water with a splash. You're glad the water is shallow here.
    <br><br>
    <<tentacle_forest_events>>
<</if>>

:: Tentacle Forest Thighs
<<effects>>

You climb atop a low-hanging tentacle, and shimmy along with length between your thighs.
<<set _rng to random(1, 2)>>
<<if _rng is 1>>
    It sways a little, but you manage to hold on. You journey between the larger tentacles, before looping back around to the clearing.<<gthighskill>><<thighskill 1>>
    <br><br>
    <<destination_tentacle_forest>>
<<else>>
    It sways this way and that. The rocking is too violent for you to cling, and you fall to the ground in a heap.
    <br><br>
    <<tentacle_forest_events>>
<</if>>

:: Tentacle Forest Oral
<<effects>>

You attempt to take one of the vines into your mouth.
<<set _rng to random(1, 2)>>
<<if _rng is 1>>
    It seems to follow your head, and enters your mouth without much difficulty. You eagerly lap up the nectar.<<goralskill>><<oralskill 1>>
    <br><br>
    <<destination_tentacle_forest>>
<<else>>
    It sways away from you, and it lightly smacks you on the cheek when you try to persist.
    <br><br>
    <<tentacle_forest_events>>
<</if>>

:: Tentacle Forest Hands
<<effects>>

You reach for the fruit. The tentacle 'branches' they attach to lift as you do, pulling the fruit beyond your grasp.
<<set _rng to random(1, 2)>>
<<if _rng is 1>>
    You manage to snag one by jumping.
    <br><br>
    Despite its juicy appearance, it tastes most similar to pork. <<ghandskill>><<handskill 1>>
    <br><br>
    <<destination_tentacle_forest>>
<<else>>
    Even jumping just makes the tentacles jump away in response.
    <br><br>
    <<tentacle_forest_events>>
<</if>>

:: Tentacle Forest Feet
<<effects>>

You try to stomp on one of the slugs, but the threat gives it a burst of energy, and it slithers away with surprising speed.
<<set _rng to random(1, 2)>>
<<if _rng is 1>>
    You catch it before it makes it to the stream. White fluid squirts from the tip, deflating it and leaving it similar to the other slugs. Now free of its extra bulk, it escapes into the stream. <<gfeetskill>><<feetskill 1>>
    <br><br>
    <<destination_tentacle_forest>>
<<else>>
    It slips into the stream before you can catch it.
    <br><br>
    <<tentacle_forest_events>>
<</if>>

:: Tentacle Forest Anal
<<effects>>

You try to read the writing etched on the walls. The symbols change as you look, resettling into new,
<<set _rng to random(1, 2)>>
<<if _rng is 1>>
    strange patterns. Meaning floods your mind. You blush.<<ganalskill>><<analskill 1>>
    <br><br>
    <<destination_tentacle_forest>>
<<else>>
    disturbing patterns. Meaning floods your mind. You shudder.
