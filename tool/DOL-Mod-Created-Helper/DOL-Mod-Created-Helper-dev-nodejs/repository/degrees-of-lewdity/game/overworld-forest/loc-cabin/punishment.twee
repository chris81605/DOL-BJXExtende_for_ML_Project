	The cage door pops open off its hinges, and for a fleeting moment hope blooms in your chest at the prospect of escape. However, the hope is soon replaced by guilt when you remember how hurt Eden was bringing you home.
	<br><br>

	Swallowing, you sit back down and hug your legs to your chest. Soon, Eden emerges from the bathroom, drying <<his>> hair off with a towel. <<He>> pauses when <<he>> sees the state of the cage.
	<br><br>

	"You're that sick of being cooped up, huh?" <<he>> says. "Well, I can't blame you for that. Come on, you've earned your place. Just don't piss me off again." Eden juts <<his>> finger in your face as you crawl out.
	<br><br>

	You watch as <<he>> folds the cage up and puts it away. You hope you never see it again.
