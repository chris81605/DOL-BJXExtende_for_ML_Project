It takes some elbow grease, but you both eventually file all the rods down smoothly. With that done, you help Eden construct the rest of the coat stand, starting from creating its base, to drilling holes in its top to set the coat arms.

As the final touch, Eden lacquers the stand and leaves it to dry overnight.

:: Eden Loveseat Work
<<effects>>
<<switch $edenloveseat>>
	<<case 1>>
		Grabbing some leftover wood, you and Eden start cutting out the side arm rests, drilling in some holes and attaching them together with screws. Next, you cut out the base stretcher for the arm rests, then work on cutting out the front and back boards.
		<br>
		With that done, you attach the arm rest to the stretcher, completing the first part of your project.
	<<case 2>>
		This time, the two of you cut out the seat base, creating notches in the inner support. Next, you cut out the seat slats, and start assembling them together by placing the slats in the notches.
		<br>
		To finish it up, you join the outer frame with some superglue and a few screws.
	<<case 3>>
		Now, you and Eden place your inner support planks and screw them in, aligning the cleats and attaching them with screws.
		<br>
		You do the same with attaching the slats in the notches. The loveseat's foundation is halfway done.
	<<case 4>>
		You and Eden turn your attention to creating the upright back of the loveseat.
		<br>
		It's thankfully a similar process of cutting out notches and placing the supporting slats inside.
	<<case 5>>
		With most of the loveseat's foundation complete, you and Eden spend your time sanding the wood down in the clearing.
		<br>
		Though it's not the easiest process in the world, you know that sanding before the foundation is assembled would save you a lot of time in the long run.
	<<case 6>>
		Now that the foundation's been sanded, you and Eden start putting it all together. You position the seats, securing them by drilling in some screws in the corner.
		<br>
		Next, you join the upright back, once again securing them in with screws. You and Eden step back and take a look at your work. The only thing missing now are some cushions.
		<br><br>

		<i>You can buy materials in the shopping centre.</i>
	<<case 7>>
		Using the foam cushions as a template, you cut the batting and attach them to the cushions with superglue. Next, you cut out the cloth and start sewing together some cushion covers.
		<br>
		With that done, you place the covers around your foam base, completing your cushions.
	<<case 8>>
		As the last step, you place your cushions on top of the frame, completing your loveseat. Knowing that this wasn't an easy project to tackle, looking at your work fills you with a sense of pride.
		<br>
		You glance around the cabin one more time. With all your new additions, the cabin's looking better than ever, and you smile to yourself in satisfaction for a job well done.

		Grabbing the pillows, this time you focus on the water, giving it a glowing orange hue. You also add some swans in for more detail.

		Taking the pillows again, you turn your attention to the sky. You alternate between yellow and orange threads, until your project is complete.
		Eden would be happy when <<he>> sees this.
	<<case 4>>
		You grab another pillow, thinking about what design you'd work on this time. Eventually, you settle on sewing in the trees of the forest.
		Grabbing some brown thread, you start working on the tree trunks, making sure to pack them tightly together.
	<<case 5>>
		You grab the pillow again and, using some green thread, start sewing in the leaves. You make sure to alternate between different shades for extra detail in your design.
	<<case 6>>
		Grabbing the pillow, you finish the landscape by sewing in the ground. When you're done, you place it next to the other pillow you previously worked on.
		The sight of a job well done makes you satisfied, and Eden would be happy when <<he>> sees this.
	<<case 7>>
		You grab another pillow and spend some time wondering what your next design will be. Looking around, inspiration strikes. You decide on sewing the cabin clearing.
		Taking some thread, you spend some time sewing in the cabin, working your way through all the small details.
	<<case 8>>
		Grabbing the pillow again, you start working on sewing in the garden plots and spring. You find yourself peering out the window at times for reference.
	<<case 9>>
		Taking the pillow, you finish the scene by focusing on the sky. It takes a bit, but when you're done, you place it with all the other pillows you worked on.
		Seeing them fills you with a sense of accomplishment, and you're sure Eden would be happy too.

	Eden leads you to the dining table and treats you as best <<he>> can with a first aid kit. You notice a look of guilt on <<his>> face as <<he>> tends to you, almost as if <<hes>> blaming <<him>>self for your injuries.
