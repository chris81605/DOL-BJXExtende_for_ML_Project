You awaken to the sound of wet sloshing. You shoot up straight, looking around.
<<if Time.dayState is "night">>
	It's too dark to see anything.
<<else>>
	You don't see the source.
<</if>>
<br><br>

A shiver runs up your spine. You're not sure why, but you feel like you need to move.
<<if $bogwater gte 1>>
	You wade through the water, pulling yourself up onto the walkway.
<<else>>
	You scramble to your feet, trusting your instincts.
<</if>>
<br><br>

You take a step back. Just in time. A muddy black appendage shoots up from the murky water, grasping at where your leg just was. <<stress 12>><<ggstress>>
<br><br>

From the darkness between the trees, dim pairs of yellow light flicker into existence. Dozens. Hundreds of limbs shoot up, grasping the walkway as if to make it one with the swamp. The wood creaks and groans. Masses of mud rise from the depths. A chorus of howling shrieks fills the dead air. <<trauma 30>><<gggtrauma>>
<br><br>

Adrenaline finally unfreezes your paralysed muscles, and you run.

<<effects>>
You keep running. You don't know which way you're going. More shapes appear from the water ahead. More eyes peer from every direction. Your lungs burn.
<br><br>

You push onwards. The sounds are almost unbearable. Stars creep into your vision. The walkway pushes back against your feet, seemingly trying to wear you down.
<br><br>

You run until you throw yourself off the end of the walkway, tumbling into the moor. You look back into the bog, but see nothing pursuing you.
<br><br>

You collapse onto your back, exhaustion finally overtaking you. It takes some time to catch your breath and steady your nerves. <<gtiredness>><<tiredness 8>>
