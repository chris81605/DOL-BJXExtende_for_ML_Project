			You are approached by the Black Wolf. "Was looking for <<ppackbrother>>," <<bhe>> says, regarding you with a smile. "Need to show something." Without warning, <<bhe>> wraps an arm around you and picks you up, making you freeze in <<bhis>> grasp.

			<<bHe>> drops you off at the base of a tree, before covering your face in loving licks. You manage to wiggle yourself free, just in time to notice Black Wolf's belly. It has a large and bumpy form. Black Wolf draws closer once more and nuzzles you affectionately. Given their behaviour towards you, you're quick to realise who the parent of the pups is going to be.

			Black Wolf untangles <<bhimself>> from you at last, before turning to head back to the cave. <<bHe>> turns around to meet your gaze, waiting for you to follow. It might be best to stay around the cave for now.

"Allowed <<ppackbrother>> to breed me, should feel honoured to father my first ever litter." <<bhe>> declares.

You do as instructed. <<bHis>> irritable temper towards you makes it clear who the other parent is.

It looks big and bumpy. You bring your hand closer and feel it up. Black Wolf stands up once more and licks your face. It doesn't take you long to realise who the parent of the pups is going to be. Whatever seemed to have <<bhim>> upset seems to have banished completely.
			<br><br>
			You try to stand up, but the Black Wolf refuses to let go, almost as if afraid of you leaving. It might put <<bhim>> at ease if you stayed at the cave for now.

			<br><br>

			"<<pPackbrother>> is one of us now, but... Pack knows, about human cub." <<bHe>> says with a trembling voice, refusing to make eye contact. "<<pPackbrother>> will always be welcome, but this is no place for human."
			<br><br>

			The <<beasttype>> leads you outside and into the woods. You walk together until you reach the end, where the forest meets the edge of town. The Nightingale street hospital can be seen through the trees.

			"As far as can go, please be safe." You pet the <<beasttype>>, <<bhis>> ears drop in response. <<bHe>> licks your hand. "Will always be family, may <<ppackbrother>> never forget." <<bHe>> says before turning away, disappearing into the trees.

			You gently run your hand across the <<beasttype>>'s fur. <<bHe>> stands up once more. The <<beasttype>> rubs <<bhis>> head against your belly. You understand that the pack knows of your pregnancy, and that your offspring is in fact human. A cave of wolves is no place to raise a baby. You feel a deep sense of bond to the <<wolf_cave_plural>>, and begin to think that you and them think the same. You stand up.
			<br><br>

			You walk through the forests with the <<beasttype>> in tow, <<bhe>> stands by you at all times. You eventually reach the edge of the town, the Nightingale hospital can be seen in the distance. You crouch down and hug your canine friend goodbye. <<bHe>> warmly returns your show of affection, seemingly thankful for your decision. There is no doubt that you are part of their family by now.

			"<<pPackbrother>> looking to nap as well?" <<bhe>> asks. The <<beasttype>> tries to relax, but something seems to trouble <<bhim>>. "Didn't want to say before, but pack is uneasy," <<bhe>> claims. "<<pPackbrother>> is one of us, but pack cannot care for human cub." Most of the <<wolf_cave_plural>> must have realized you are pregnant, and that you are not waiting for a pup.
			<br><br>

			"Allowing human cub here is not safe. Not for human or pack." The <<beasttype>> holds your arm in <<bhis>> mouth gently. <<bHe>> takes you out of the cave and towards the town. <<bHe>> releases you, now simply leading the way for you to follow.
			<br><br>

			Moments later you make it to the edge of the woods, where the town and the forest meet. The Nightingale street hospital can be seen through the trees. "As far as can go, be safe." <<bHe>> turns around before leaving. "Hope <<ppackbrother>> can understand," <<bhe>> says before disappearing into the forest.

			Feeling tired, you take a seat near a lonely stump. A <<beasttype>> joins you soon after. <<bHe>> lays down next to you. The <<beasttype>> rests by your side, but something seems to have <<bhim>> upset. The <<beasttype>> stands up and gently nudges your belly, <<bhis>> ear drops and <<bhe>> whimpers.
			<br><br>

			The pack must have somehow realized by now that you are pregnant, and that they shouldn't be expecting a new wolf to join their ranks. This is no place to raise a baby. The <<beasttype>> holds your wrist gently in <<bhis>> mouth, leading you away from the cave.
			<br><br>

			You traverse the woods together, until you make it to the edge of town. The Nightingale street hospital can be seen beyond the trees. The <<beasttype>> nudges you in the direction of the hospital, watching you leave before making <<bhis>> departure.

			<br><br>

			The <<beasttype>> growls in fury. <<bHe>> bites on your wrist hard, pulling you away from the cave with terrifying strength. You follow <<bhis>> pull to alleviate some of the pain. The <<beasttype>> takes you through the forests and into the edge where the woods meet the town, the Nightingale street hospital can be seen through the trees. <<bHe>> lets go.
			<br><br>

			"<<pPackbrother>> should be ashamed, humans belong with humans!" The <<beasttype>> says as <<bhe>> releases you. "Don't care if <<ppackbrother>> is Black Wolf's favorite, will not allow <<ppackbrother>> to endanger pack." <<bHe>> declares, before turning away and heading back into the forest.
			<br><br>
		<<else>>
			Feeling tired, you take a seat near a lonely stump. You spot a <<beasttype>> marching angrily towards you.
			<br><br>

			The <<beasttype>> growls menacingly, <<bhis>> eyes fixated on your belly. The pack must have figured out by now that your baby isn't going to be one of theirs. The <<beasttype>> lunges forward, but <<bhe>> goes for your forearm instead.
			<br><br>

			The beast's maw is clamped tightly around you, keeping your arm restrained. <<bHe>> pulls you away from the cave with terryfing strength. You decide to follow the animal's lead, so as to reduce the pain in your arm. The <<beasttype>> drags you across the forest and into the edge of town, the Nightingale street hospital can be seen beyond the trees.
			<br><br>

			At last the <<beasttype>> releases you, before marching back to the cave. You try to follow <<bhim>> back, but <<bhe>> turns around and bares <<bhis>> teeth at you. You won't be welcome into the cave while being pregnant with a human.

	<<else>>
		<<if $monster is 1>>
			Feeling tired, you take a seat near a lonely stump. You join a crestfallen <<beasttype>> resting alone. "Hasn't <<ppackbrother>> caused enough pain yet?" <<bhe>> complains. <<bHe>> stares at your belly uncomfortably, knowing that you're waiting for a human baby.
			<br><br>

			"If <<ppackbrother>> still cares about pack in slightest, will go now. Pack will crumble if human is born here."
			<br><br>

			The <<beasttype>> nods at you to follow. <<bHe>> leads you through the forest and into the edge of town, where the Nightingale street hospital can be seen through the trees.
			<br><br>

			"<<pPackbrother>> is still part of pack, but human cannot be allowed. Pack cannot endure another tragedy like this." Having made <<bhis>> point clear, the <<beasttype>> turns to leave back into the forest.
			<br><br>

		<<else>>
			Feeling tired, you take a seat near a lonely stump. You join a crestfallen <<beasttype>> resting alone. <<bHe>> whimpers, <<bhis>> gaze lingering on your belly. The pack must have figured out by now that you are awaiting a baby, not a wolf cub.
			<br><br>

			Despite your differences with the pack, you realize that a human baby would make things more difficult and dangerous for everyone. The <<beasttype>> stands up and nudges you from behind, leading you away from the cave.
			<br><br>

			You walk through the woods together, until you make it to the edge of town. The Nightingale street hospital can be seen at the distance. You turn to pat the <<beasttype>> goodbye, but the animal steps back, afraid from your touch. <<bHe>> darts away and disappears into the bushes.

		Black Wolf tilts <<bhis>> head in confusion. <<bHe>> pushes you down onto your back and tries to sniff your nether regions.
