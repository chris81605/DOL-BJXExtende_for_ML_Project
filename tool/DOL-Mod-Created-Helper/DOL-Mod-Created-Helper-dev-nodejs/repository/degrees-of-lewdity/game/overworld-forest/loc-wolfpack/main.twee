	The Black Wolf treads towards the edge of the forest all the while waggling <<bhis>> tail and looking back at you, as if inviting to come along.

	You play something similar to hide-and-seek with the younger <<beastsplural>>. They're hesitant to stray too far from the cave, but there are many hiding places nearby. Their sense of smell gives them an advantage and they're quick to find you every time, but it's fun.
