		You spot an angry female wolf marching towards you, with your pups in tow.
		<br><br>

		<<bHis>> nipples look sore. <<bHe>> must have been feeding your pups, and by the looks of things, they haven't been gentle about it.

		The female wolf growls at you before turning to leave. Black Wolf will have to look for a different pack sister to help next time.

    The pups have gathered around the Black Wolf's breasts. They shove each other away trying to claim their share of the milk.

    Black Wolf remains still and absent-minded, only giving the pups the occasional growl whenever they become too feisty.

You won't let that stop you. You ignore the wolf's warning and shift closer once again.

    Despite the pups' hungrily drinking earlier, there seems to be enough for you as well. You move over to the other breast and repeat the process. Black Wolf remains still, yet remorseful.

    You stand up once finished, wiping some leftover milk off your mouth. Black Wolf looks ashamed.

You bare your breasts and lay down on the ground. You pat the ground, beckoning some of the pups over.
<br><br>

A few of them take notice of you, and split off from the group to start piling around you instead. It doesn't take long for the pups to begin hungrily feeding.

The Black Wolf seems mildly confused, but relieved. 

<<if $monster is 1>>
    "Not sure if will be enough, even with both of us..." <<bhe>> says with a smile.

The pups continue with their feeding for a while longer, before settling down at last. Black Wolf moves over and gives your face a long lick of thanks, before settling down along with the pups to rest.

    You remove your top and lower yourself to the ground, laying on your side. You leave your breasts exposed to the pups, who don't waste any time before piling on them.

    The small beasts push and shove each other aside. They squirm and compete for a spot, with you only being able to feed two at once. The pups give the occasional bite, making you wince.<<gpain>><<violence 3>>
