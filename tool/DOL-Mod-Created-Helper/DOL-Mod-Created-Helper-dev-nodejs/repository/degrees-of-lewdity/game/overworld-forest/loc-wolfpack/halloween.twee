You approach the noisy mob of wolves. They've gathered around a distressed and injured member. It's the <<beasttype 0>> you saw at the lake being attacked by students.
<br><br>

<<if $monster is 1>>
	The Black Wolf rushes to the scene, shoving the others aside. "Move, stand back!" <<nnpc_he "Black Wolf">> yells. <<nnpc_His "Black Wolf">> eyes widen in shock after seeing the <<beasttype 0>>. The Black Wolf carries a look of concern, but tries <<nnpc_his "Black Wolf">> best to hide it. "What has happened to pack sibling?"
	<br><br>

	"Was hungry, looking for scraps at... lake." <<bHe 0>> admits ashamed. "Humans saw and attacked. Some followed while ran away..." <<bhe>> says, still shaken from the encounter.
	<br><br>

	"Pack not supposed to tread lake!" the Black Wolf protests. "Why would sibling disobey orders?" <<nnpc_Hes "Black Wolf">> beside <<nnpc_himself "Black Wolf">> with anger. "Humans attack sibling, and now walking into pack territory," <<nnpc_he "Black Wolf">> growls. "Must teach lesson!"
<<else>>
	The Black Wolf rushes to the scene, shoving the others aside. <<bHis>> eyes widen in shock after seeing the <<beasttype 0>>. You spot what seems to be a look of concern on the Black Wolf's posture. <<nnpc_He "Black Wolf">> draws closer to inspect the wolf.
	<br><br>

	Upon closer inspection, you notice that the <<beasttype 0>> has a minor injury over <<bhis>> side, no doubt from <<bhis>> run in with the students. The bruise doesn't seem very concerning, so the animal is most likely just spooked.
	<br><br>

	The Black Wolf catches on to the scent lingering over the <<beasttype 0>> and growls furiously in response. <<nnpc_He "Black Wolf">> must be aware that this is the work of a human. The Black Wolf rises up and marches on in the direction of the lake.

	Before the Black Wolf has a chance to leave, a younger <<beasttype 1>> stands in the way and embraces <<bhim>>. "Black Wolf stay!" <<bhe>> pleads. "Must protect pack!" The Black Wolf stops for a moment and considers. <<nnpc_His "Black Wolf">> demeanor changes, and <<nnpc_he "Black Wolf">> crouches down to soothe the trembling <<beasttype 1>>.
	<br><br>

	"Will go look for humans!" declares another <<beasttype 0>>. "Will teach not to intrude in pack territory!"
	<br><br>

	The Black Wolf nods in response, while seeing to the other member's state. <<nnpc_He "Black Wolf">> glances over at you, but says nothing.
<<else>>
	Before the Black Wolf has a chance to leave, a younger <<beasttype 1>> stands in the way and snuggles <<nnpc_him "Black Wolf">>, nudging <<nnpc_him "Black Wolf">> with <<bhis 1>> snout. The youngster must be worried about the cave being left unprotected. The Black Wolf stops for a moment and considers. <<nnpc_His "Black Wolf">> demeanor changes, and <<nnpc_he "Black Wolf">> crouches down to soothe the trembling <<beasttype 1>>.
	<br><br>

	Another <<beasttype 0>> seems to have other plans. A small group of <<wolf_cave_plural>> gathers around it, intent on hunting down the responsible humans.
	<br><br>

	The Black Wolf seems satisfied with the proposition. <<bHe>> stays in order to see to the other member's state. <<bHe>> glances over at you curiously.

	"If going after humans, should let me follow," <<bhe 2>> declares. "Saved from them once, allow to return favor." A hint of apprehension betrays <<bhis 2>> seemingly determined attitude.

	You wonder if the dog may feel an odd sense of gratitude towards you for saving <<bhim 2>> from the pound. It may prove advantageous to have more help during the expedition.

You walk through the forest along with <<if $blackDog>>the Black Dog and<</if>> the rest of the <<wolf_cave_plural>>. A more well-seasoned <<beasttype 0>> follows a set of tracks for the others to follow.
<br><br>

Your group suddenly comes to a halt. Despite your disadvantage in tracking skills, you hear the echoing of laughter while the smell of beer hangs in the air. The students from the lake must be nearby. You sneak through the bushes and spot three people around your age. They can be heard bantering and laughing loudly to one another.
<br><br>

"You're a real bastard, you know that?" says a <<person4>><<person>> wearing a scarecrow costume.
<br><br>

"Oh shut your mouth, that fucking mutt was going to attack us. I'm a bloody hero!" answers the <<person5>><<person>> through <<his>> robot helmet.
<br><br>

"It looked just like my dog, I wanted to pet it!" adds a <<person6>><<person>> donning a lion onesie.

The chatter amongst themselves, completely unaware to your presence.

	The <<person4>><<person>> moves closer, but is immediately jumped by a <<beasttype 1>>. The beast catches the student by surprise, and drives <<person4>><<him>> down onto the ground.

<br><br>

The other two students yell. The <<person6>><<person>> reaches for a rock in the ground. As <<he>> winds for a throw, <<his>> arm is caught in the maws of a <<beasttype 0>> emerging from the bushes. They tussle for a moment, before the <<beasttype 0>> manages to wrestle <<person6>><<him>> to the floor.
<br><br>

"Call someone, go get some help please!" they shout to the <<person5>><<person>>. <<He>> comes to <<his>> senses and makes a run for it, before being cut off by two other pack members. The <<person>> freezes in place.
<br><br>

The three are rounded up together. The pack circles around them with an anger they can barely contain.

Satisfied with your stunt, you turn to leave back to the cave, only to notice that the <<wolf_cave_plural>> aren't following.
<br><br>

The pack remains captivated with the students, who stick together and tremble in fear. A <<beasttype 0>> eyes the <<person5>><<person>> with unrestrained lust, before lunging for <<him>>, making <<him>> shriek.
<br><br>

"Leave <<him>> alone!" yells the <<person6>><<person>>, smacking the <<beasttype 0>> in the face. The <<beasttype 0>> growls, angered. The other <<wolf_cave_plural>> grow ever bolder with their advances.
<br><br>

You yell at the <<wolf_cave_plural>>, telling them to leave the three alone.
