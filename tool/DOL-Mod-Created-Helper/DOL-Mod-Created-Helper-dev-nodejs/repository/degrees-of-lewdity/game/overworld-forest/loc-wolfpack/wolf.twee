Together, you walk into the forest, searching in a circular route around the cave with the Black Wolf sniffing constantly.
<<if $wolfgirl gte 6 or $cat gte 6 or $fox gte 6>>
	You assist the best you can, but only pick up the scent of the pack.
<</if>>
<br><br>

After a full loop, nothing is found. You widen the circle and try again, but whatever the Black Wolf had picked up must have been imaginary, or no longer nearby.
<<if $monster is 1>>
	<<bHe>> grows more agitated as you progress. "I smelled it. I know it!"
<<else>>
	<<bHe>> growls and looks around carefully. <<bHe>> seems agitated.

	<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
		"Obviously, whatever it was must have fled," you chuckle. "Like it could beat the both of us!" You slap <<bhim>> on the back as you smile. The Black Wolf stands up a little straighter as <<bhe>> continues onwards.
	<<else>>
		"You were doing your duty. It's okay." You place your hand on <<bhis>> shoulder to comfort <<bhim>>. It seems to work.

	<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
		"Well done, moron. I could have been napping right now!" You let out an exasperated sigh, before you're backed right up against a tree by the angry <<beasttype>>.

			"Your idea!" <<bhe>> growls, before quickly stepping away again. <<bHe>> almost looks ashamed. "Sorry. Forgot who was alpha." <<bHis>> shoulders slump as <<bhe>> continues.

			As quickly as <<bhe>> advances, the Black Wolf pulls back. <<bHis>> ears flattening against <<bhis>> head as <<bhe>> whines. You think it is an apology.

<<if $phase is 1>>Happy <<bhe>> seems in better spirits<<else>>Ignoring <<bhis>> mood<</if>>, you keep walking towards the grassy clearing near the river. It's the last place to check.
<br><br>

Just as with the trees surrounding the cave, nothing more threatening than a field mouse can be found in the clearing. With the light of the moon overhead, the few flowers you can make out look quite pretty.
<br><br>

Satisfied nothing will attack you in your sleep, you turn to make your way back. The Black Wolf blocks your path.
<<if $monster is 1>>
	"Rarely get time alone," <<bhe>> rumbles. <<bHis>> tail swishes as <<bhe>> leans in and nuzzles into your neck. <<bHis>> hands start to wander.
<<else>>
