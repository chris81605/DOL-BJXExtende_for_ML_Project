Most of the walls, floor and ceiling look hewn from natural rock, but one portion looks like concrete. A metal door opens, and a <<person>> and <<person2>><<person>> march through. You glimpse a table and playing cards behind them.
<br><br>

"Welcome to your new home," the <<person1>><<person>> says while the <<person2>><<person>> appraises you. "We mine crystals here. Well, the slaves mine them. Our job is to keep the slaves in line. But that's none of your concern. Your job is to clean, and keep us entertained. Lucky you."
<br><br>

The <<person2>><<person>> turns back to the room with the playing guards. "New toy is here," <<he>> shouts. An approving murmur answers. <<He>> grabs your arm, and pulls you through.

"Right," the <<person1>><<person>> one says. The <<person2>><<person>> jabs your <<bottom>> to keep you moving. "Here's how this works. We mine crystals here.

<br><br>

You walk down one of the tunnels, and arrive at a gate. Ragged <<people>> walk by the other side, carrying pickaxes. They don't spare you a glance.
<br><br>

The <<person2>><<person>> slices through your bindings, shoves a pick against your chest, and pushes you through the gate. It clatters shut behind you.

A dozen <<people>> sit around the room. They look up as you enter. One licks <<his>> lips.

The <<person1>><<person>> unholsters <<his>> baton, and prods your cheek. "Kiss it," <<he>> says.

A jostling movement awakens you. You're lying in a metal container. Lights float by overhead. <span class="pink">A ballgag has been stuffed in your mouth, and your arms are tied.</span>
<br><br>

A <<person>> peers at you over the rim. "Just in time," <<he>> says. The container comes to a halt, and <<he>> grasps your shoulders. "Wanted some privacy with the public whore." Now higher, you can see more of your surroundings. You were lying in a mine cart, on a track in some forgotten corner of the mines. The only light comes from a lamp at the <<persons>> hip.
<br><br>

<<He>> pulls you from the cart. While you're still unsteady from the movement, <<he>> trips you up and pushes <<himself>> atop you.
