:: childBathe

You fill a small tub with warm water, and prepare the towels and a new nappy beforehand. You take <<childname>> in your arms gently, and carry <<childhim>> to the bathtub, making sure to put <<childhim>> in a safe position.
<<set _rng to random(1, 5)>>
<<switch _rng>>
	<<case 1>>
		You rub <<childname>> gently with the warm water, making sure to clean between the folds of skin, and holding <<childhis>> little body with one hand. The softness of <<childhis>> skin as you rub makes you feel extremely at ease. The baby seems to be tickled by your touches, and swings <<childhis>> legs in the water, making some of it splash on your clothes and face. You can't help but smile at the situation.<<ltrauma>><<trauma -6>>
	<<case 2>>
		You gently rub <<childname>>'s head in circular motions with a handful of baby shampoo. The sweet aroma of strawberry fills the ambient, and bubbles begin to appear in the water. Your child seems curious, and periodically takes one of <<childhis>> fingers to the bubbles, popping them. <<childHis>> mellow laughter echoes through the room as <<childhe>> is distracted by the foam in the bathtub.<<ltrauma>><<lstress>><<trauma -6>><<stress -6>>
	<<case 3>>
		You start the bath by trying to soap your baby's body. <<childHe>> doesn't seem to like the feel of water on <<childhis>> skin, let alone seems to be enjoying your attempts to cleanse <<childhim>>. <<childname>> threatens to cry as you continue the bath, but you manage to calm <<childhim>> down after a little effort. <<childHe>> pouts in distaste until the end of the cleaning session. When you're finished, <<childhe>> doesn't seem to want to let you carry <<childhim>> back, and makes uncontent sounds when you pick <<childhim>> up.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<<default>>
		Just by touching the water, <<childname>> lets out a high-pitched, incessant cry. <<childHe>> flails <<childhis>> legs and arms into the water trying to get free as you struggle to rub <<childhim>> properly. Water splashes quickly soak your clothes. <<childHe>> continues throwing a tantrum until the end of the bath, leaving you with a headache.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
<</switch>>
<br><br>

When you're done bathing <<childHim>>, you lay <<childHim>> on a towel and gently dry <<childHis>> body with a softer fabric. You carefully finish the moment by changing the baby's nappies and putting <<childHim>> back in <<childHis>> crib.

	You only give <<him>> a smile in response.

	"You're serious? I mean, I've been feeling kind of full these days, so I guess it wouldn't hurt to,"  <<he>> says.

	<<He>> sits on the ground and gestures to you to get closer. Alex lays your head on <<his>> lap and brings your face closer to <<his>> $alexBreasts. You quickly envelope <<his>> nipple with your mouth and start to suck.<<ggarousal>><<arousal 600>>

After a few minutes, the milk stops flowing and you move your mouth away from <<his>> $alexBreasts, leaving Alex panting.
<br><br>

"I think you're taking the term 'cow<<girl>>' too serious, pal," <<he>> laughs. <<He>> stands up and fixes <<his>> clothes before leaving the nursery.

	You enter the hallway and head upstairs to the nursery. The door is slightly open, and you can see Alex standing by <<childname>>'s cot.

	"Hey partner, sorry if I woke ya," Alex says, not looking away from the cot. "Thought I heard our little fella crying."

You step closer, and Alex immediately wraps <<his>> arm around your shoulder before bumping <<his>> head against yours. <<His>> gaze is fixated on <<childname>> sleeping form. Being this close lets you get a good smell of alcohol, more so than normal.
<br><br>

"Never thought I would settle down with a kid, with the farm and all. Still feels surreal," Alex says while brushing <<his>> finger against the baby's cheek.
<br><br>

You mimic the action on the other cheek. <<childname>> stirs but soon settles down into both your touches. Alex softly chuckles. <<He>> pulls <<his>> hand away before turning to face you.

"Come on now, let's get you back to bed," <<he>> says, gently pushing you along.

Alex looks slightly taken aback by the question. <<He>> freezes up before sighing. <<He>> turns away.
