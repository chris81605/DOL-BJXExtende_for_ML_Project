Zephyr stares across the sea at a cruise ship, dipping above and below the waves. The ship turns to intercept the other vessel.

Zephyr strides towards you, excitement on <<his>> face. "I have a special job for you," <<he>> says.

"Fine," Zephyr says. "We'll do this the old fashioned way. I want ye close though."

The pirate ship races towards its quarry, lining up behind it. The pirates board smaller boats attached to the side of the larger vessel, and cast off. Zephyr goes first, with you beside <<him>>.
<br><br>
The cruise ship seems unaware of the approaching pirates. They throw grappling hooks up the side of the still-moving boat, creating impromptu rope ladders. Zephyr climbs first.

"We don't have long," Zephyr says to the crew in an uncharacteristically hushed tone. "Snatch what ye can, and we'll get gone. Ye have five minutes."

You enter the ship interior with the pirates, and trail Zephyr as they shake down passengers, and ransack their rooms, taking thing of clear value.
<br><br>
One of the pirates whistles from outside. Zephyr rushes to them, and looks out over the sea. Another ship sails closer, far smaller than either the pirate or cruise ship, but the sight of it shakes Zephyr. "Everyone!" <<he>> shouts. "We're leaving. Get here or on the double, or be left behind."
<br><br>

You climb back down the rope ladder. Zephyr follows, and sits beside you.
<br><br>

The flottila of small boats sails away from the cruise ship, back to the pirate ship. Zephyr orders it to turn and sail in the opposite direction at once.
<br><br>

The pirates are too busy arguing over loot to bother you for the moment.

"We're just gonna leave ye here for a little while," Zephyr says, pulling a knife from <<his>> jacket. "Be seeing ye soon." <<He>> hacks through the rope, and your boat plunges into the water below.
<br><br>

The pirate ship tears ahead without you, then turns away from the cruise ship, heading in the oppposite direction.

The ship slows as it pulls up alongside you. A <<person>> leans over the side above. <<covered>> "There's a <<girl>> in there," <<he>> shouts. "And <<pshe>>'s naked."
<br><br>
More heads appear over the side of the boat, and look down at you. "Bring <<phim>> up!"

A <<person2>><<person>> in a harness appears at the edge of the boat, climbs down the side with the help of a roap, and lands beside you.

Captain Zephyr strides onto the stage, and fires <<his>> pistol into the air once more for good measure. This time, even the less savvy members of the audience look panicked. Some try to run, only to be met by other pirates brandishing weapons.
<br><br>
"Now why'd ye want to run for?" Zephyr shouts. <<His>> voice doesn't carry very well. This ship is much larger than <<hes>> accustomed to. <<He>> wrestles the microphone away from the <<person1>><<person>>.

"I want all ye valuables, all cash, credit cards, jewellery, and the like, in one of me sacks." Pirates march through the audience, shaking them down for everything of value. "Anyone resists, gets blasted." <<He>> fires <<his>> pistol into the air again.

The pirates continue robbing the audience of valuables, tearing jewellery off necks, watches off wrists, emptying purses and wallets into their sacks. No more guns are fired, but anyone who resists gets beaten while the rest of the audience look away.

Laden with ill-gotten gains, Zephyr and the pirates vacate the cruise ship. They board a number of small boats parked around the larger vessel, climbing down on impromptu rope ladders. They take you with them.
<br><br>

They're too distracted by arguments over loot to bother you on the journey, or once back aboard the pirate ship.
