You sail around the strange island, until a rock comes into view, jutting from the land and overhanging the waves below. "That's it," Zephyr says. "We'll anchor there." The crew look disconcerted. More so when figures emerge from the forest, wearing strange antlered masks.
<br><br>

The ship halts several feet away. The crew throw ropes to the masked islanders, who pull the ship closer and fasten the lengths around stout pillars. They look carved from the rock they protrude from.

The sailors watch the islanders warily. You can't tell how the islanders feel, beneath their masks. Some busy themselves with the rope, but others just stand, motionless. Bows are slung over their backs.
<br><br>

Zephyr rests one foot on the rail, and leans forward. "I've brought the silver, and something else besides." Two hands grasp your shoulders, and push you towards the edge of the ship. Zephyr steadies you. "I think this creature's worth an extra barrel, aye?"
<br><br>

Two of the islanders turn to each other.

Zephyr cracks open one of the barrels, sticks a finger in, and licks it. "This is watered down!" <<he>> roars. <<His>> crew rest hands on weapons. The islanders unsling their bows. The two groups face each other, staring.

You run until you almost collapse from exhaustion, and take cover behind a particularly thick tree. You listen through the beating of your heart, but hear no pursuit.

You wait. Zephyr breaks the suspense with a sharp laugh. "Only joking!" <<he>> shouts. <<His>> crew laugh with <<him>>, but look don't look any less nervous. The islanders just stare.

Zephyr and <<his>> crew load the barrels onto their ship, and raise the anchor, leaving you to the mercy of the islanders. Though some do wave at you.
