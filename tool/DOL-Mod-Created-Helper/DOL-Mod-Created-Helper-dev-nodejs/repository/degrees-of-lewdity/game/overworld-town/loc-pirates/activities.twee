        You find a small wooden figurine, perched on a shelf. The wood looks aged, and the design foreign. You're not sure where it's from, but it might be worth something to a collector.

        You hear a clink at your feet. You disturbed a copper ring. It doesn't look remarkable, but there is an engraving along one edge. Perhaps it's worth something to a collector.

    A breeze rustles through your hair, as if someone had opened a window, or a door leading outside. The air carries the damp smells of the ship, but also the freshness of the sea.

    Light seeps between the floorboards above. A shadow passes and the wood creaks as someone walks over.

    The lock clicks open. Inside you find credit cards and jewellery. It looks like a pirate's stash, loot hidden away to protect it from the others, perhaps. Handling stolen goods might bring you trouble though.
