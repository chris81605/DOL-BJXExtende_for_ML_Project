	A figure rises from beneath the bed, and a gaunt face greets you. It extends a handful of silver nails towards you, and strokes your skin. You don't dare move until it retreats into the dark.
<<elseif $kylar_parents_trust gte 60>>
	A hand extends from beneath the bed as you talk, and rests on the sheet beside you. You touch the cold silver, and colder flesh, before it withdraws.
<<elseif $kylar_parents_trust gte 40>>
	A head rises from beneath the bed. Pale eyes observe you a moment, before it disappears once more.

	You gently tug Kylar away from the chair, and <<he>> walks over to the bed with you. <<He>> flops onto it and gazes up at you with needy eyes.
