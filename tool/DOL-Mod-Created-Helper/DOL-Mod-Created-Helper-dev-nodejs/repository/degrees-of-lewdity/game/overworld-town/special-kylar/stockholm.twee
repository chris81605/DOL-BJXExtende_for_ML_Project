Kylar freezes in the middle of the room, <<his>> arms straight at <<his>> sides, and <<his>> eyes closed. <<He>> opens them, and acts with newfound surety. The madness is gone, replaced with a burning determination.

"I'm sorry I tied you up," <<he>> says, crouching behind you. "That was no way to treat my <<girlfriend>>." <<He>> fiddles with the bindings, and they come loose. You stand and stretch.

"We can't meet my parents dressed like this," Kylar says. "Good thing I prepared!" <<He>> holds out <<his>> hand. <<He>> shivers in pleasure as you take it. "Th-this way."
<br><br>

<<He>> leads you from the room. Garlic has been nailed around the other side of the door, some rotten, some fresh. <<He>> turns right, then left, then right, leading you up a set of stairs. The door at the top is criss-crossed with padlocks. <<He>> produces a key, and opens them all in a jiffy.
<br><br>

The door opens, revealing a spacious yet old-fashioned kitchen. Rubbish overflows from the bin, covering much of the floor. "S-sorry about the mess," <<he>> says, sheepish.

Kylar leads you down a corridor, towards what looks like the front door. There's another staircase on the right, but <<he>> instead leads you left, into a living room. Most of the furniture has been stacked on one side, creating space for a large alembic, and other scientific equipment. Much of it is covered in dust, but some, including the alembic, have been used recently. A choking, curry-scented chemical smog fills the air.
<br><br>
"This is my parents' lab," <<he>> says. "They d-don't use it anymore. Here." Lying on a table are a few sets of clothes. Old-fashioned formalwear. Kylar holds up a dress with one hand, and a suit with the other. "Y-you can wear what you like," <<he>> says. "They both fit. I m-measured."

The curry smell gives way gradually, overcome by the scent of garlic. It's only once dressed that you realise that the <<print $worn.upper.name>> is lined with garlic cloves.
<br><br>

"They like the smell," Kylar says. "Or dislike it. It will keep you safe either way. N-not that there's any danger!" <<Hes>> dressed <<himself>>. <<His>> clothes are more worn down than yours. "R-right," <<he>> says. "Right this way."

<br><br>

Kylar follows your gaze. "Those are my parents," <<he>> says. Something thuds against the wall. The portrait trembles. "That's th-them. Y-you should know, that they're-" <<He>> hesitates. "They're sick."

Kylar pushes open a door, revealing a large bedroom. There's a four-poster bed on the far side. Dust hangs in the air.
<br><br>

"Mum," Kylar says. "Dad. I-I've," <<his>> fists clench with anxiety, or excitement. "I've brought my <<girlfriend>> to meet you."
<br><br>

Silence answers, at first. Then you hear a rustle beneath the bed, and see a flash of silver. A shape crawls out with terrifying speed, snaking across the bedroom floor and looming in front of you. White eyes pierce you from a pale, hairless face.
<br><br>

"Mum?" Kylar asks. "Dad? S-sorry I still can't tell you apart. Meet my <<girlfriend>>. I-I hope you get on well."
<br><br>

Kylar's parent sniffs the air and grimaces, revealing a pair of long fangs. It raises a hand towards you. Each finger is tipped with a blade of silver.
<br><br>

"Th-that's enough meeting for now," Kylar says, stepping between you. Kylar's parent snarls, and lunges back beneath the bed.

Kylar closes the door, and walks deeper into the house. "The other might be out," <<he>> says. "They're afraid of the town, but they'll enter the forest through the back garden. T-technically some of the forest is part of this property."
<br><br>

You come to another door. "This is my room." <<He>> opens the door, revealing a short staircase leading further up.
<br><br>

You climb, and emerge in a long converted loft. There's a bed not far away. Beyond it sits a desk, and a computer with six monitors. Three on the desk proper, and three more attached to the wall above and behind it. The top left is playing pornography.
<br><br>

Kylar sprints forward. You catch a glimpse of a body pillow bearing your likeness, before <<he>> conceals it with a sheet. You've never seen a face so red.

Kylar tries to stammer a protest, but you silence <<him>> with a laugh. "It's a nice room." You're not lying, though it could be tidier.
