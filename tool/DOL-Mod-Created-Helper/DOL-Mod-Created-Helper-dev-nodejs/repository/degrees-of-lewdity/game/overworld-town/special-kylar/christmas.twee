You rise from your covers,
<br>
And you creep to the door.
<br>
What wanders the twilight,
<br>
A creature from the moor?
<br>
"Ho ho HO!" says a voice from above.
<br>
"Ho,"
<br>
"Ho,"
<br>
"HO!"
<br><br>

The last word it seems,
<br>
Was said in surprise,
<br>
And echoed to you,
<br>
From more than one side.
<br><br>

You run through the exit.
<br>
Along all the hallways.
<br>
You arrive at the tree.
<br>
Stood statue like always.
<br><br>

"H-ho ho ho!" says the voice once again.
<br>
This time from the chimney.
<br>
"Ho,"
<br>
"Ho,"
<br>
"Hooooooo!"
<br><br>

An avalanch of soot
<br>
Surges down from above.
<br>
Booted legs then follow.
<br>
Flailing arms wearing gloves.
<br><br>

<<Hes>> stuck in the chimney
<br>
Just until, with a tear
<br>
<<His>> red dress rips apart,
<br>
Leaving <<him>> very bare.
<br><br>

<<He>> lands in the ashes.
<br>
And covers <<his>> bare chest.
<br>
Just a pair of
<<if $pronoun is "m">>
	undies,
<<else>>
	panties,
<</if>>
<br>
Covering all the rest.
<br><br>

But this is not Santa.
<br>
Nor beast from the polar.
<br>
On the ground, lied sprawling.
<br>
Is a snow-covered Kylar!
<br><br>

<<if $phase is 0>>
	You tug down the red dress
	<br>
	And drop it at your feet.
	<br>
	<<He>> takes it, so grateful.
	<br>
	<<His>> face red like a beet.
<<else>>
	You stand still and goggle.
	<br>
	As Kylar tries to stand.
	<br>
	One arm on <<his>> bare chest.
	<br>
	Reaching out with one hand.
<</if>>
<br><br>

Now footsteps approach you.
<br>
Now Kylar, <<he>> watches
<br>
And looks out with horror.
<br>
Oh, of all the botches!
<br><br>

<<He>> dresses and so fast.
<br>
Just before they arrive.
<br>
The orphans, they heard you.
<br>
Now Kylar must survive.
<br><br>

<<He>> runs to the window.
<br>
Then <<he>> pulls, and <<he>> tugs.
<br>
But locked tight by Bailey.
<br>
No escape from the thugs.
<br><br>

Kylar winces and faces
<br>
The shocked line of orphans.
<br>
<<His>> face one of horror.
<br>
No grip on <<his>> organs.
<br><br>

The orphans, they goggle.
<br>
Then they cry out as one.
<br>
"It's Santa! It's Santa!"
<br>
Said just like a mantra.
<br><br>

Kylar's role <<he>> accepts,
<br>
Thinking through these percepts,
<br>
Beware of your night gaze,
<br>
Shushing voices that raise.
<br><br>

Wait with expectant eyes,
<br>
Much in need of surprise,
<br>
No santa would want to disappoint
<br>
Lover's eyes at knifepoint.
<br><br>

Chinney bag Kylar lifts,
<br>
As they jump and they cheer.
<br>
Handing out sweet gifts
<br>
As more orphans appear.
<br><br>

One by one get their share.
<br>
Chocolates and candies and cookies
<br>
and all handled with care.
<br>
"Thank you Santa!", some even say,
<br>
Going out on their way.<<ggghope>><<hope 10>>

No to run, nor to hide
<br>
<<His>> gifts gone in yuletide.
<br>
"Sorry, they were for you."
<br>
Kylar shakes, naught to do.
<br><br>

<span class="lewd">An idea quick to strike!</span>
<br>
Beneath skirt, hopes you like.
<br>
"Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store,
<br>
Maybe Christmas means a little bit more."
<br>
Something else then, of use,
<br>
Thing to lover seduce.
<br><br>

<span class="lewd"><<His>> own

Removed with no restraint.
<br>
You grabbed gift with surprise,
<br>
Could yours be such a prize?
<<if $kylarSeen.includes("commando")>>
	<br>
	For <<his>> kindness, for <<his>> jewel,
	<br>
	You forgive <<his>> broken rule.

Bailey's rage is <<his>> right.
<br>
Shouts as loud as <<he>> might,
<br>
Kylar runs kind of cool.
<br>
You do too, you're no fool.
<br><br>

Now so safe and so far,
<br>
You think through the saga,
<br>
Of your Santa Kylar.
