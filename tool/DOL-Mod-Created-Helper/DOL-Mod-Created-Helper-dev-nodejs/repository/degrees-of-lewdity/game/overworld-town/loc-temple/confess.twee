:: Temple Confess Approach
<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "temple">><<temple_effects>><<effects>>
You approach the confessional, secluded against the wall of the main hall. Ornate symbology dances across the center trim, continuing on the heavy wooden doors on each side.
The right side is open for penitents to confess their sins, while the left side is reserved for the priest, or 'confessor'. A small brass bell hangs in the middle.
<br><br>

A large half-circle is gouged into the stone around the booth.

You enter the right side of the booth, closing the heavy door behind you. A simple bench sits before you. Thick wooden slats covered in symbols obscure the other side, and a metal shutter sits under them.
Foam soundproofing material is visible in some of the corners. Whatever you say here won't be heard outside. You also notice a stack of towels on a small shelf above you.
<br><br>

Before long, you hear the other door open, and a silhouette sits on the other side. You hear a flick, and smell the burning of incense.
A <<personsimple>>'s voice greets you.
"Welcome, child. Lay your sins bare, so they may be forgiven." <<He>> speaks in an unusual intonation, concealing <<his>> natural voice.

<<npc Jordan>><<person1>>
You approach the confessional, secluded against the wall of the main hall. Ornate symbology dances across the center trim, continuing on the heavy wooden doors on each side.
The right side is open for penitents to confess their sins, while the left side is reserved for the priest, or 'confessor'. A small brass bell hangs in the middle.
<br><br>

A large half-circle is gouged into the stone around the booth.
<br><br>

"You look unsure of yourself, child." You feel a hand on your shoulder. It's Jordan. "You seek to act as a confessor, yes? I'll show you how."
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Confess Tutorial 2]]>><</link>>
<br>

:: Temple Confess Tutorial 2
<<temple_effects>><<effects>>
You enter the confessional with Jordan.
<br><br>

The interior is more spacious than the outside lets on, enough for both of you to fit. A cushioned bench sits before you.
Jordan gestures to the wooden slats that separate the two sides. "This is the seal of confession. It represents the privacy of the penitent's sins. Their sins are only for the Lord to hear, through you."
<br><br>

You take note of a small metal shutter under the seal, and a silver bowl attached to the wall under it. Jordan notices your gaze. "A symbol of purity. The silver vessel takes in the sins of the penitent, where they are forgiven."
<br><br>

<<He>> gestures to a rope next to the bench. "This operates the bell outside. Only pull this if you are faced with another member of the temple who has confessed to breaking their vows. It will call in the specialists to purify them."
<br><br>

<<He>> moves on to a case full of small sticks. "Each time a penitent enters, light this incense and speak the phrase 'Welcome. Lay your sins bare, so they may be forgiven.' In most cases you will aim to forgive and guide your penitent. The phrase you will speak for forgiveness is 'I name you forgiven by word. You must still forgive yourself by act.' In the more severe cases of sin or illegal activity, you should be firm and demand they repent."
<br><br>

<<He>> continues. "If you believe your penitent to be full of a great amount of sin and corruption, you will tell them to write their name and address on one of these pieces of paper." <<He>> gestures to a stack of papers on a shelf, opposite to the seal.
"This is known as contrition. In giving their sacred name, letting all the world know of their sins, they will be forgiven. The specialists will help them purify themselves at a later date."
<br><br>

Jordan places a hand on your head. "You must use your best judgement to properly attend to your penitents. I know you can do it. Good luck, child." Jordan leaves you alone in the booth.

		"Jordan's flock is the face of our order. They take confessions. They give alms, and run the soup kitchen, and smite the creatures from the other side that creep through the holes. But they won't ever harm... us. Humans. They're powerless against humans who have fallen to corruption. This is why we're needed."

		<<He>> delights in speaking. "Without us, the temple would have fallen long ago. In fact, it did, once. Jordan and <<nnpc_his "Jordan">> order can stir soup, and spar, and fight monsters of mist and sin, but ask yourself this:

That innocence is a shield, one that the Children of Auriga can never pierce. Belief is real, more real than the Elk's vile spawn.

		<br><br>

		"Through these holes, Auriga's corruption seeps in. It infests. It tempts. It bends the will of those it seeps into, who, knowing or otherwise, make the holes larger. This corruption is... released from a victim," <<he>> licks <<his>> lips, "by the peak moment of coitus."<br>
		"Purges."<br>
		"Urges." <<ggawareness>><<awareness 20>>
		<br><br>

		"Expelled, this released corruption seeps back into the world, where it will infest someone else, or coalesce as a monster. On sacred ground, such as here in our sanctified home, it can't. Our wards contain it. Instead, it's absorbed by the corrupted's partner. This is still not ideal, as it simply shirks the taint onto someone else."<br>
		"Proliferate."<br>
		"An overflowing cup."<br><br>

		"However. If the corrupted individual's partner has been inducted into our order through a trial, the corruption can not take root in them, either. With nowhere to escape, it will be strangled by the holy truth within them. By the gift of Virgo." Every robed figure in the room stands at attention, stomping their right foot.

		<br><br>

		"You sit before all of us. Jordan's flock, the majority, remain unaware of the finer details of our activities, but we know much about them in turn. It must remain this way. This is the seal of confession. We take the burden of the sins of the many, so few have to suffer their weight."<br>
		"Hold fast."<br>
		"Martyrs."<br><br>
	<<case "cruel">>
		The <<bishop>> doubles over and laughs yet again. "Oh, <<sister>>. You don't know the first thing about cruelty. There will come a day where you see, first hand, the deeds of the Children of Auriga. Then you will know what cruelty truly means. I can not fault you, you are but a child to the rest of us.

		"Another."<br>
		"Never."<br><br>

They gnaw like rabid animals in heat, and worship a profane concept of passion and lust far beyond sanity. We oppose them in every way we can. We fill the holes. We free their victims. We punish," <<he>> licks <<his>> lips, "their followers."

The <<bishop>> nods. "Take as much time as you need to process these revelations. They will become your norm."
<br><br>

The left and right priests come to your side, each one gently taking you under an arm.<br>
"Slowly."<br>
"Carefully."<br><br>

They help you stand, but don't let go. You're immediately grateful, as your legs nearly give out under you. "The corruption is still within you. Your body has not yet acclimated to the process. Take it slow."

The priests help you get steady again. You can just barely see under their hoods. A silver handprint is painted, or perhaps tattooed, on one cheek for each of them.

The <<bishop>> nods again, and the other figures in the room begin to file out through shadowed doors. Each one that passes by bids you welcome.
<br><br>

"We'll be in touch soon. For now, continue your duties in the confessional. This is but the first step. Welcome, <<sister>>." The <<bishop>> bows to you before making <<his>> exit.
<br><br>

Once you're able to stand by yourself, the two priests that represent the bishop's hands guide you to a doorway.

You emerge into the temple cloister. The bishop's hands each bow to you.<br>
"Be safe, <<sister>>."<br>
"Be swift, <<sister>>."<br><br>
