:: Temple Bailey Intro Nod
<<effects>>

You nod, and Bailey relaxes <<person1>><<his>> grip. <<He>> turns back to Jordan. "I'll visit to check up on <<phim>>," <<he>> says. "Say, once a week."
<br><br>

<<if $temple_bailey_known is 1>>
    A look of pain darken's Jordan's face. "Is that-" <<person2>><<he>> begins to asks, but the <<bishop_hands>> turn to <<him>> in unison.
    <br>
    "Remember your promise."
    <br>
    "Don't forget your vow."
    <br>
    "But I spoke with <<phim>> outside the dark one's home, and-"
    <br>
    "Your vow cannot be broken."
    <br>
    "Think of what's at stake."
    <br><br>
    Jordan swallows <<his>> words. "I'm- I'm sorry child." <<He>> buries <<his>> face in <<his>> hands, and runs away.

    <br>
<<else>>
    Jordan nods. <<person2>>"It's good to stay in contact with family. You're welcome here whenever you like."
    <br><br>

    Satisfied, Bailey strides down the centre aisle, and leaves the temple.

You pull away from Bailey.

<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
    "Please leave," you say. "I don't want you disturbing the worshipers."
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
    "You can't barge in here like this," you say. "It's sacred ground."
<<else>>
    "You have no power over me here," you say.
<</if>>
<br><br>
Anger flashes across Bailey's face, but it's gone so fast you might have imagined it. 
<br><br>

Jordan watches, <<person2>><<his>> gentle eyes giving nothing away. <<He>> opens <<his>> mouth to speak to Bailey, but the <<bishop_hands>> turn to <<person2>><<him>> in unison.
<br>
"No interference."
<br>
"Follow the scripture."
<br><br>

Jordan nods. "You will handle it?" At the right <<person3>><<priest>>'s nod, Jordan gives you another smile, then turns and walks away.
<br><br>

Bailey regards the <<bishop_hands>> with caution. <<person1>><<His>> eyes flick between them.
<br><br>

"The temple will not intervene."
<br>
"Our <<sister>> will suffer."
<br><br>

Bailey doesn't look encouraged by this frankness. <<person1>><<He>> lowers <<his>> voice. "You won't interfere?" The pair shake their heads as one.
<br><br>
"It is written."
<br>
"It is the will of the bishop."
<br><br>

Bailey seems uneasy, but satisfied enough. <<He>> strides down the centre aisle, and leaves the temple.
<br><br>

The pair walk in opposite directions, and vanish in shadowy alcoves.

Jordan looks at you with a worried expression. "Is everything okay <<sister>>?" <<he>> asks. "That is your guardian, correct?"
<br><br>

Before you can respond, the <<bishop_hands>> turn to Jordan in unison.
<br>
"Remember the scripture."
<br>
"Remember your vow."
<br><br>

Jordan nods, and closes <<person2>><<his>> eyes. "I'm sure your guardian wants what's best for you." <<He>> turns and walks away, and the pair follow suit, albeit in opposite directions.

:: Temple Bailey Pay

<<rentpay>>

The pair watch Bailey stride from the temple.
<br><br>
"A nuisance."
<br>
"Worse than <<person1>><<he>> in this world."
<br><br>
They bow to you, then turn and disappear, side-by-side, down one of the many passages surrounding the hall.

    "I'm not paying you," you say. "You can't make me. Not here."
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
    "Piss off," you say. "Or my <<brothers_and_sisters>> will beat the shit out of you."
<<else>>
    "Go away," You say. "You're not gonna start a fight here."
<</if>>
<br><br>
"So be it," Bailey snarls.
<br><br>
The pair watch <<person1>><<him>> leave. "<<Sister>>," they say in unison.
<br>
"We can't make enemies of humankind."
<br>
"We must endure their abuses."
<br><br>

With that, they turn as one, and leave the hall.
