A six-armed, six-winged angel statue stands resolute in the centre. Its bottom two arms hold a large mirror at ground level.

    <<His>> eyes meet yours, and <<he>> cries out in surprise, losing control of <<his>> whip. It winds around <<his>> body, snapping <<his>> arms and legs together. <<He>> tumbles to the ground.

You explore the tunnels leading away from the cloister. <<Monks_and_Nuns>> emerge from various rooms, or otherwise pass you in the corridor, and give you a polite nod. You find old prayer rooms, as well as modern amenities.
<br><br>

Other corridors, however, lead to a serpentine labyrinth. Here, the function of the rooms is less clear. You glimpse odd garb, strange altars, and stranger processions.
<br><br>

You wander for a while, unable to find the way back to the cloister. You hesitate to ask for directions, from embarrassment rather than fear, as at no point does anyone make you feel less than welcome. At last however, you emerge back at the cloister, and its jovial gargoyles.
<br><br>

You look at the closest gargoyle. It grins back at you. One hand rests on the statue beneath it, and its tail curls around the one above. They look ready to take flight, removing the support from the ceiling above.
<br><br>

"<<Sister>>." It's Jordan. <<He>> smiles at you from beneath <<his>> cowl. "You're exploring so soon. Come, let me show you around."
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Cloister Explore 3]]>><</link>>

Jordan leads you down one of the underground passages, and pauses beside a wooden door. "Remember," <<he>> says over the sound of clanging metal. "Everything you learn here is a secret to the outside world." The clanging becomes much louder as the heavy door swings open.
<br><br>

A <<person2>><<monk desc>> and <<person3>><<monk desc>> dance in the middle of a circular room. They pirouette away from each other, then lunge to meet once more, leaving a trail of sand in their wake. Then they repeat. Each time, a clang of metal rings out. They're not dancing. They're fighting.
<br><br>

Three others stand with arms folded, watching. Jordan claps <<person1>><<his>> hands, and the battle stops.
<br><br>

"This is one of our training rooms," Jordan says. <<He>> <<person2>>addresses the <<monk desc>>. "<<if $pronoun is "m">>Brother<<else>>Sister<</if>>. Please present your weapon."
<br><br>

The <<monk desc>> rests <<his>> baton in both hands as <<he>> steps forward, holding it out for you to see. Rings of metal surround a thick wooden shaft.
<br><br>

"We use two weapons in our duties here," Jordan continues. "This baton is one of them." <<person1>><<He>> reaches beneath <<his>> habit, and produces a coiled whip. <<He>> holds it out for you to inspect. "This is the other. Choose one."

The <<person2>><<monk desc>> hands you the baton. It's heavier than it looks, particularly at the tip.
<br><br>

"Now step into the arena <<sister>>," Jordan says, addressing you. "Don't worry. This is just a demonstration."
<br><br>

You step with Jordan onto the sand. <<person3>>The <<monk desc>> hands <<person1>><<him>> a baton of <<his>> own. "By sparring, we become closer to one another. Don't put too much force into your blows. Not here." Without warning, <<he>> springs forward <span class="red">delivering a painful smack to your hip</span> and landing behind you.<<pain 1>><<gpain>>

You don't wait for further words. You spring at Jordan while <<his>> back is turned, aiming your baton at <<his>> hip. <<He>> ducks and turns with miraculous agility, spinning on the spot, both evading your blow and delivering <<his>> own to your ankle.
<br><br>

In the moment you fall, instinct takes over, and you grasp the hem of <<his>> habit. You glimpse surprise on <<his>> face, then <<he>> topples, landing atop you. The other <<monks_and_nuns>> laugh.
<br><br>

Jordan looks bashful as <<he>> stands, and helps you to your feet.
<br><br>

You hold your baton ready for another attack. Jordan pirouettes, kicking up sand, but doesn't follow with another assault. Instead, <<he>> bows.

Jordan hands you the whip. You hold it by the handle, letting the thong fall to the ground.
<br><br>

"Now step into the arena," Jordan says, addressing you. "Don't worry. This is just a demonstration."
<br><br>

You step with Jordan onto the sand. <<He>> produces another whip from <<his>> habit. "By sparring, we become closer to one another." <<He>> lets <<his>> whip unfurl, then cracks it. "We only aim at the feet while sparring." Without warning, <<he>> lunges forward. The whip dances into life beside <<him>>, wrapping around your ankles as <<he>> lands behind you.

You try to squirm free from the coil around your ankles, but it's too tight. Jordan pirouettes, holding the handle of <<his>> hip aloft as <<he>> does, then releases you with a flick of <<his>> wrist.
<br><br>

<<He>> doesn't follow up with another assault. Instead, <<he>> bows.

"These weapons take practice," Jordan says. "You're welcome to visit here to train whenever you like. There should be someone to spar with, as long as it's not too late. You can carry your weapon from the temple, too, but there are rules."
<br><br>

"First rule. <span class="pink">Never use your weapon on another natural being.</span> Whether person or animal."
<br>
"Second rule. You can only carry one weapon at a time."
<br><br>

"You're welcome to swap your weapon here whenever you like. The baton might seem harder to master, but it is not so. Some argue that it is easier for beginners. I'm not so sure."
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Cloister Explore 6]]>><</link>>

An uneasy silence descends on the arena. The <<monks_and_nuns>> glance at each other. "There is," Jordan begins. "Something you need to see. Follow me."
<br><br>

<<npc "Jordan">><<person1>>

Jordan leads you from the room, and back to the cloister. You follow <<him>> around the edge, and down another passage. There are no doors along the corridor here, save at the end. Jordan opens it.
<br><br>

Inside are a <<person2>><<monk desc>> and <<person3>><<monk desc>>, standing beside a lit brazier. Smoke rises through a hole in the ceiling.
<br><br>

The pair bow to Jordan, and observe you with curious eyes.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Cloister Explore 7]]>><</link>>

<<person1>>"Light the brazier," Jordan says. A curious command, as the brazier is already lit. "I want a demonstration for our new <<sister>>."
<br><br>
The <<person2>><<monk desc>> approaches a row of shelves along one wall, and reaches into a jar. <<He>> withdraws the hand, now clasped, and returns to the brazier.
<br><br>
A sweet-smelling incense fills the room as <<he>> flicks a fistful of powder on the flame.<<garousal>><<ghallucinogens>><<hallucinogen 60>><<arousal 600>>

<<person1>>Jordan walks past the brazier, and stands at an empty portion of the room. The pair step to <<his>> right and left, facing each other. "We'll need your help," Jordan says to you. "Look here."
<br><br>

You notice, now, grooves on the floor. Like a trap door of stone. You take your place beside your <<brothers_and_sisters>>, and together lift the heavy slab.
<br><br>

The others stand still, as if waiting. Then you notice it, half-seen in the firelight. <span class="pink">A tentacle of shadow rises from the depths,</span> flickering in and out of existence. It's as if a battle is being fought in your mind, over whether this entity is real.
<br><br>

<br>

"This is the enemy," Jordan says, with a slightly embarrassed, but mundane, tone. As if <<he>> were showing you the facility's toilets. "There are cracks all over this town, where these things squirm through. It is why the temple is here. And why we learn to fight."
<br><br>

<<He>> retrieves the whip from <<his>> habit, whirls the thong above your heads, then snaps it down around the creature. A ghost of a glow lights the room, and the creature evaporates.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Cloister Explore 10]]>><</link>>
<br>

:: Temple Cloister Explore 10

The slab is restored with a thud. "More experienced <<brothers_and_sisters>> will go on missions to fight these creatures," Jordan says. "You are one of us, but still too green. You have other duties, however. Come."
<br><br>

You follow Jordan back to the cloister, then to the temple proper. <<He>> leads you towards the confessional. A <<person4>><<monk desc>> emerges at that moment, looking serene.

Jordan pauses, and watches <<him>> leave the building.
<br><br>

"You now have a duty to listen to the confessions of others," Jordan says. "Most people simply need forgiveness. Reassurance. The particularly sinful will need contrition." <<person1>><<He>> blushes. "They don't tell me what that involves, but I hear it's intense. Your role will simply be to mark their name down for the specialists, so you needn't worry either."
<br><br>

<<He>> pauses. Then smiles. "I'll explain more later. Follow me to the quarters. I've picked out your bed."
<br><br>

Jordan leads you up the stairs to the quarters. "You'll no longer come here just to clean," <<he>> says without interrupting <<his>> stride. <<He>> stops at a bunk near the far side of the room. "This one. The windows on this side have a lovely view of the forest."
<br><br>

You need to kneel on your bunk to get a good view, but <<hes>> right. The temple is taller than you realised. Treetops stretch to the horizon.
<br><br>

"There's a cupboard for you to keep your clothes, and a screen, here, for the sake of decency."
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Cloister Explore 14]]>><</link>>
<br>

:: Temple Cloister Explore 14
<<effects>>

"There's one more thing to show you," Jordan says. "Another secret."
<br><br>

Rather than walk towards the entrance, <<he>> continues to the end of the quarters, into an alcove hidden from view. You follow, and a large portrait of a stern-looking priest greets you.
<br><br>

"Don't be afraid of the scary expression." Jordan says, running <<his>> fingers over wall. "That's just to scare away initiates." <<He>> presses <<his>> palm against one of the stone bricks. It shifts a little, and the portrait swings open, cutting the stern figure in half. A secret stairwell is revealed, spiralling out of view.
<br><br>

Jordan motions for you to lead the way.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Cloister Explore 15]]>><</link>>

You descend the steps, and find another tall picture. This one of a silver gate, surrounded by trees and drenched in moonlight.
<br><br>

After another brief fumble, Jordan presses a brick and the gate swings open, revealing a corridor heading to your left and right. "Recognise it?" Jordan asks. "These are the tunnels beneath the cloister. This is useful, because-" <<he>> pauses. "Let me show you."
<br><br>

<<He>> steps into the corridor, and opens the door opposite. At once, you hear the sound of running water. "The showers are here." <<He>> smiles. "It won't do for our muddy <<brothers_and_sisters>> to march the long way around!"
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Temple Cloister Explore 16]]>><</link>>

Jordan bows. "I've informed you of the basics," <<he>> says. "I must return to my own duties. Welcome, <<sister>>."

Your batons meet. The slightest mistake on your part would cause your defeat. Instead, you parry it like any other. Your opponent skids on the sand, throwing it into the air as they tumble to a halt.

After a while <<he>> starts to get the hang of it, a little, managing to redirect the energy of your attack and forcing you into a quick recovery. You deflect <<his>> counter attack, and smack <<him>> with your own.

Then, for a moment, you glimpse a pattern in the chaos. Rather than step backwards, you step forwards and bring your whip against <<his>>, forcing <<him>> to react. <<He>> evades your attack, and twirls into a counterattack, snapping the length of <<his>> weapon around your legs.
