It's a workshop, you think. Arcane gizmos cover the surfaces, and jumbles of spare parts litter the floor. There's an old cylindrical boiler at the back, but the pipes have been rerouted through a vibrating machine, spotted with blue lights.

"Excuse the clutter," Sirris says. "This is just the only place here where you can get some privacy. Here." <<He>> hands you a couple of bundles of fabric. One is a <span class="lblue">cowprint onesie,</span> the other a set of <span class="purple">babydoll lingerie</span>.
