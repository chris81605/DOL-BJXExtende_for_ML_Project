You are in the compound on Elk Street. Three red brick buildings stand surrounded by a chain link fence. The gate is guarded by security personnel.

<</if>>
<br><br>

You <<wraithShamble>> toward the central building, reaching the door. You reach for the door handle and try to pull it open. It's locked.
<br><br>

<<if $phase is 1>>
	You successfully pick the lock and open the door. "<span class="wraith">Nimble,</span>" your voice says. An inexplicable feeling of contentedness courses through you, making you feel warm inside.
	<<stress -6>><<trauma -6>><<lstress>><<ltrauma>>
	<br><br>

	It retakes control of your body as you step forward.
<<elseif $phase is 2>>
	You give the pale figure a mental nudge, and it chuckles with your throat, retaking control. You step forward, walking through the door like you were passing through jelly. It's a very odd sensation.
	<<trauma 6>><<gtrauma>>
	<br><br>
<</if>>

The inside of the building is dominated by a large lift. You see no way to operate it, but you don't think the pale figure cares. You step in front of the lift and wave your arm, and the lift doors are forced open by a cloud of fog from inside.
<br><br>

You step into the lift, and it immediately plummets straight down without closing the doors. It slows before you reach the bottom,
<<if $compoundWraith is "willing">>
	landing gently.
<<else>>
	though not enough to ensure a completely painless landing.
	<<pain 4>><<gpain>>
<</if>>
<br><br>

Before you is a network of hallways with concrete walls. Florescent lights line the ceiling, though many are burnt out, and intertwine around exposed pipes and wires. The tile floor is cracked and dirty in several areas, and at least one hallway you see leads directly into a cave.
<br><br>

<span class="nextLink"><<link [[Next.|Elk Compound Possessed 3]]>><</link>></span>

You keep your head focused on one hallway in particular, striding towards it. Nobody is walking the halls; there are a few scientists in adjacent rooms, but they don't notice you.
<br><br>

Eventually, you reach the room you've been staring at, and silently turn the corner. You see several metal crates stacked against the wall, with a <<person2>><<person>> carrying one across to the wall and a <<person1>><<person>> observing.
<br><br>

"That should be the last one," the <<person>> says. "Careful with them. Mayor <b>Quinn</b> wants them in tip-top shape."
<<stress 2>><<gstress>>
<br><br>

"Mayor <b>Quinn</b> can suck my ass," the <<person2>><<person>> grunts. "Fuck, these things are heavy. What even are they?"
<<stress 2>><<gstress>>
<br><br>

Every time they say Quinn's name, an alien anger flashes through you. You suspect the pale figure has an axe to grind.
<br><br>

You step into the room, and the guards turn to look at you. The <<person1>><<person>> immediately sets aside <<his>> clipboard and presses a button on <<his>> hip. Then, <<he>> marches toward you, accompanied by the <<person2>><<person>>.

A sudden noise draws your attention. A trio of guards, led by a <<person>>, run into the room. <<He>> takes one look at the guards on the ground, before turning to you. "Grab <<phim>>." The <<fullGroup>> advance.

<<switch $compoundWraith>>
	<<case "willing">>
		The pale figure places a hand on your shoulder, and two more around your ears. "<span class="wraith">May not a single of their claws touch you. Hie away, <<pcpetname "wraith">>.</span>" Still keeping its hands around your ears, it lets out a piercing shriek. Even with your ears covered, it's incredibly loud. You can only imagine how loud it is for the guards, who immediately stagger and collapse.
		<br><br>

		The figure closes its mouth, removes its hands and disappears. You run into the hallway and onto the lift, and the doors automatically close. The lift carries you up, and you walk out the door back into the compound.

		Two arms emerge from your back and cover your ears. "<span class="wraith">As you help me, so I you, <<pcpetname "wraith">>.</span>" Still keeping its hands around your ears, it lets out a piercing shriek through your mouth. Even with your ears covered, it's incredibly loud. You can only imagine how loud it is for the guards, who immediately stagger and collapse. Your throat feels scraped raw.

		The pale figure pulls itself out of your body through your back, making you stumble forward. Your stumble turns into a run as the figure disappears. You run into the hallway and onto the lift, and the doors automatically close. The lift carries you up, and you walk out the door back into the compound.

		The guards surround you and grab your arms. "Take <<phim>> to interrogation," the <<person>> says. "<<pShe>> has a lot to answer for." You try to break free, <span class="red">but the pale figure holds your body still.</span>
