You slip into the changing room. They're so bewildered they don't notice you hide inside an empty locker.
<br><br>
"I think someone misplaced their clothes. Wait. This is a skirt. What the hell?"
<br>
"Hey, have you seen my trousers?"
<br>
"This shirt is way too small for me, did it shrink?"
<br><br>
An uproar builds. Most of the boys seem flustered, but a couple seem fascinated.
<br><br>
"What are we supposed to do now? We can't walk through the halls in our swim trunks!"
<br>
One of the smaller boys speaks up. "Well-" he swallows. "These clothes follow the dress code. We shouldn't get in trouble if we-"
<br><br>
He's cut off as a larger boy shoves him against a closed locker.

"If you're so eager," the larger boy says. "You first."
<br><br>
The smaller boy stammers for a moment. All eyes are on him. You stifle a giggle as he pulls a skirt over his swim trunks. One of the boys encourages him, and then another joins. The tension in the room drops.
<br><br>
"Hey, you don't look half bad in that." A firm slap to the rear reddens his face even further. He is pushed towards the door. "Wh-what about the rest of you?"
<br>
"You have to keep watch. Make sure no one comes in."
<br><br>
The other boys begin to get dressed. Some of them take to it better than others. The largest boy looks ridiculous. Another rips three shirts before finding a fit.
<br><br>
One by one, the boys exit the changing room. They are hesitant at first, but soon enough, you are left alone in the room.

"Are you kidding? The guys are probably right outside, waiting to take pictures of us!"
<br>
"I don't have time for this. I have a date tonight."
<br><br>
One of the girls pulls on a pair of boys' trousers a few sizes too big for her, along with a mismatched shirt. She waddles over to the door, holding the trousers by the waist. The other girls watch in stunned silence as she strides out the locker room. A few moments later she speaks from the hallway.
<br><br>
"No one's out here. It's empty."
<br><br>
The remaining girls look at each other, waiting to see who will make the next move.

"Screw it. Better than just a towel."

One by one, they wear the boys' clothing. After a few more moments of silence, they exit the changing room in a group.
