<br><br>

The two of you start to stretch and push outwards with your arms and legs as hard as you can, while matching the timing of your movements. The stomach tightens around you, spewing fluids all over you. Your clothing seems to degrade from the fluid, though you're unharmed. Robin doesn't seem to be getting squeezed or drenched the same way you are, maybe because <<he>> isn't quite in the stomach of the snake.
<br><br>

The more you move, the more you are massaged and soaked in fluids. You start having trouble keeping your mouth above the fluid as it fills up the stomach. You cry out in fear. Before you scream however, the squeezing motions of the stomach change and start pushing you upwards, jamming your cheek against Robin's. The two of you are squished against each other as the snake forces you out of its mouth. You and Robin are left lying in a puddle of slime as the ill snake slithers away.
<br><br>

Robin hugs you but doesn't say anything. The ordeal must have been as traumatising for <<him>> as it was for you. You help each other clean off as much slime as you can, but the stickiness makes it hard to remove. At least you found the picnic basket.

You tell Robin that you're both going to be okay. You reach your hand towards where you think Robin is trapped in the snake's gullet, searching for the entrance to the stomach. You push your hand through a fleshy valve and feel <<his>> slime-covered head. You tell <<him>> to take your hand. "I'm glad I'm not alone in here," <<he>> says. "These slimy walls keep squeezing me." <<He>> takes your hand.
<br><br>

Unable to escape the snake that's swallowed both of you whole, there's nothing to do but wait as you're squeezed and massaged. The viscous fluids eat away at your clothes. It isn't long until you're naked and completely covered in slime. The walls contract and rub against your <<breasts>> and <<genitals>>, and you realise with shame that your body is responding to the stimulation. The warmth and pressure on your body is having an effect, and you feel hot. Robin seems to be feeling it too, as <<his>> whimpers have turned into soft moans that escape <<his>> lips every time the snake's throat churns with <<him>> in it.

As minutes go by the constant stimulation starts to become unbearable. "I feel strange," Robin says. You spasm from the feeling of the stomach walls pressing against your crotch, and the snake's stomach tightens around you in response, pleasuring you further.
<br><br>

<<arousal 10000>>
<<orgasm>>

The more you move, the more you are getting massaged and soaked in fluids. You start having trouble keeping your mouth above the fluid as it fills up the stomach. You cry out in fear. Before you scream however, the squeezing motions of the stomach change and start pushing you upwards, jamming your cheek against Robin's. The two of you are squished against each other as the snake forces you out of its mouth. You and Robin are left lying in a puddle of slime as the ill snake slithers away.
<br><br>

Robin hugs you but doesn't say anything. The ordeal must have been as traumatising for <<him>> as it was for you. You help each other clean off as much slime as you can, but the stickiness makes it hard to remove. At least you found the picnic basket.

You pull <<him>> towards you. "W-wait," <<he>> cries. "What are you doing? Don't pull me deeper!" Before <<he>> can complain any more, you pull <<him>> into the stomach headfirst and kiss <<him>>. <<He>> fidgets at first, but starts to calm down. You break the kiss, and explain that you've been through situations like this before, and that you're not in any real danger of being digested. Robin gives you an incredulous look before the snake's stomach shifts and the rest of <<his>> body slides into the stomach.<<deviancy5>>

The stomach is now even tighter than before with two people stuck in it. You feel the smooth skin of Robin's legs press against your face. You can feel <<his>> breath on your crotch. The walls of the stomach close in again and your mouth is pressed against <<his>> <<if $NPCList[0].penis isnot "none">>penis<<else>>pussy<</if>>, eliciting a gasp. You take the chance to start licking and sucking on <<his>> crotch through the fabric, trying to help <<him>> enjoy this situation as much as you are.

The viscous fluids seeping into the stomach aren't hurting you, but the same can't be said for what's left of your clothes. The squeezing of the snake's stomach forces your bodies to slip and rub against each other, stimulating your <<breasts>>. Robin's face is forced against your crotch, and while <<he>> isn't returning your oral attention, <<his>> gasps and moans feel just as good against your exposed <<genitals 1>>. With no clothing in the way, you press your lips against Robin's <<if $NPCList[0].penis isnot "none">>penis<<else>>pussy<</if>> directly, licking all over.
<br><br>

Pressed against Robin in the snake's stomach, you both continue to stimulate each other while being rubbed all over by slimy flesh. Robin gasps and arches <<his>> back, rubbing <<his>> <<if $NPCList[0].penis isnot "none">>penis<<else>>pussy<</if>> against your lips as <<he>> moans into your crotch.
<br><br>

<<arousal 10000>>
<<orgasm>>

You and Robin both tremble in ecstasy, pressing and rubbing your slick bodies against each other. The snake's stomach rumbles around you. It seems like having two people shuddering with pleasure in its stomach has caused it more discomfort than it can take. As the squeezing around you intensifies, the fleshy valve by your face loosens and you and Robin are pushed out of the snake's gullet together, where you land in a slimy heap. As you and Robin lie panting from your oral sex session, the snake slithers away.
