Robin tugs your arm, and you rise from your seat.

There's no light coming from underneath the door, and you don't hear so much as a peep inside.
<br><br>

Robin doesn't usually go to bed this early. You feel a deep sense of dread.<<stress 2>><<gstress>>
<br><br>

Overcome with worry, you quietly turn the knob of the door and crack it open slowly. You peer inside, and you spot what appears to be a lump in the bed covers.
You can hear Robin sobbing softly underneath.
<br><br>

Robin hasn't left <<his>> room in a while, nor has <<he>> come to talk to you. <<He>> may need someone to talk to.

You push open Robin's door. It creaks open, the lights from the hallway purge the darkness coming from <<his>> room.
You hear a frightened gasp upon entering the room, and Robin pulls the covers tight over <<himself>>.
<br>
The room fills with an eerie silence as you call out Robin's name.
<br>
For a few seconds, nothing happens, and the room continues to linger in uneasiness. Until you see Robin's head emerge from beneath the covers.
<<He>> stares at you for a split second, <<his>> eyes wincing from the bright light. <<He>> ducks under <<his>> bed covers once more after spotting you.
<br><br>

You close the door behind you, returning the room to a state of near pitch black darkness. You manage to navigate yourself over to Robin's bedside and kneel beside it.
<br><br>

You call out Robin's name once again, this time more quietly. The light flickers on as you reach over to touch it, enveloping the room in a warm, orange glow.
You remain by <<his>> bedside, still and calm until <<he>> reveals <<himself>>.
<br><br>

<<His>> eyes are swollen, marked red from tears. Tear trails run down <<his>> face. You can feel the anguish emanating off of <<him>>. You ask how <<hes>> feeling.
<br>

<</if>>
<br><br>

The two of you spend the next few hours talking about whatever comes to mind, such as the latest video games to be released and school.
Robin sometimes struggles to talk about <<himself>> and <<his>> condition, but <<he>> always seems to perk back up whenever you mention wanting to take <<him>> out window shopping.

<br><br>

"I know you must be busy. I don't want to take up more of your time than I already have," <<he>> continues, but with a reluctant tone. It seems Robin has more to say.
<br><br>

Robin's face turns a shade of red. You ask what's wrong.
<br>
"Nothing, it's just..."
<br>
Embarrassment fills Robin's voice, causing <<him>> to stumble over <<himself>> as <<he>> struggles to find the right words to say.
<br><br>

"If it isn't too much to ask of you, could you stay with me? Here, tonight? I find it hard to sleep sometimes," <<he>> says. "Maybe I would feel safer with you?"

"Oh..." Robin's voice carries a mix of disappointment and sadness. "Th-that's okay! I'm a big <<personsimple>>, see? I'll be fine!"
<br>
You're not convinced, but you head towards the door regardless.

Just as you shut the door, you hear Robin let out a depressed sigh. You return to your room, feeling a sting of guilt.<<stress 2>><<gstress>>

<br><br>

Robin gives you a friendly smile. The two of you continue talking for a while longer, until the sun fully settles and the stars light up the night sky.
<br><br>

You get into bed next to <<him>>, and turn off the lamp.
<br>
"Thank you," <<he>> says out of the blue. "F-for staying with me, I mean. I already feel a lot safer. "

<<He>> rests <<his>> head on your chest and snuggles up closer to you. It feels a bit uncomfortable, but Robin seems to be completely content with the situation. You feel the soothing warmth of <<his>> body heat emanating onto you. It's comforting.

"I don't know where I would be without you."

<<His>> voice trails off into a yawn. It doesn't take long until you hear the sound of Robin's soft breathing. You find yourself succumbing to sleep yourself, your eyes close shut as you drift away into a peaceful sleep.

You desperately call out Robin's name again as you enter the deepest parts of the landfill. Your voice gets hoarse.

Out of the silence, you can hear faint but distinctly human sounds, almost as if pained. You pick up the pace as you rush towards the source.
Then, turning a corner, you see a <<personsimple>>, bound by <<his>> hands and legs to a thin metal pole in the centre of the clearing.
<span class="green">It's Robin.</span> <<Hes>> been stripped naked and blindfolded, and you can see dirt and sweat coating <<his>> body.
<<His>> wrists are raw where the ropes bind them to the pole.
Some sort of device has been strapped over <<his>> mouth and nose, with a small canister attached on the side.
<br><br>

You untie <<him>>, then lower <<him>> down on the ground as gently as you can while <<he>> coughs.
<<His>> skin is uncomfortably warm to the touch.

Robin sits on <<his>> knees for a few moments and gradually stops coughing. You lay a gentle hand on <<his>> back.
<<He>> turns <<his>> head and looks at you, <<his>> pupils heavily dilated and <<his>> face flushed.
