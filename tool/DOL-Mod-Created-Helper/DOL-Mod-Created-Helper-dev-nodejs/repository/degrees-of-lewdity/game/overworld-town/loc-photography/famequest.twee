	You approach the side of the desk, then glance at Niki. Niki nods at you. "As long as you don't touch anything."
<</if>>
You step behind the desk to examine the photos on the wall. A selection of <<group>> stare back, in elegant poses. The photos are kept inside wooden frames with glass covers, preventing damage.
<br><br>

There's a <<person3>><<person>> in <<his>> underwear, stretching <<his>> arms over <<his>> head. There's a <<person4>><<person>> in a gothic

	suit, sitting with a suitcase.
<<else>>
	gown, sitting with a parasol.
<</if>>
And there's a naked <<person2>><<person>>, posing with <<his>> hands behind <<his>> back and <<npcRevealText $NPCList[1] "lower">>.
<br><br>

You look closer. The <<person>> looks visibly uncomfortable, and
<<if $pubfame.niki.hair is "no">>
	<<hes>> completely bald.
<<else>>
	<<his>> hair is a distinct $pubfame.niki.hair.

	You quietly detach the case from the wall, before sliding the glass cover off. You remove the photo, slide the cover back on and place the frame back on the wall.
	<br><br>

	Niki abruptly spins in <<his>> chair, examining you and the empty case. <<He>> frowns, and clicks <<his>> tongue. "There used to be one right there."
	<br><br>

	With a sigh, <<he>> turns back to <<his>> desk and rummages through a cabinet. "<span class="green">Must've taken it out and forgot to replace it.</span> Shame, <span class="gold">that was the last one <<person2>><<he>> did</span>." <<person1>><<He>> pulls a new photo out and walks to the frame. <<He>> slides it in and nods, before sitting back down.

	You try to take the frame off the wall. "<span class="red">Don't touch that,</span>" Niki says. You pull away as Niki turns around to face you.
	<br><br>

	<<He>> looks between you and the frame, before pulling a cloth out of <<his>> pocket and wiping down the case. "Don't want fingerprints on the cover," <<he>> says. After a few seconds, <<he>> sits back down.

	You tap Niki on the shoulder, and <<he>> swivels around to see you. "Excuse me," you ask, "could I have this photo?"
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
	You clear your throat, and Niki swivels around to see you. "I'd be willing to take this off your hands," you say, jerking your thumb at the photo.
<<else>>
	You clear your throat, and Niki swivels around to see you. "Is this for sale?" you ask, gesturing to the photo.
<</if>>
<br><br>

Niki rolls closer to the photo and examines it for a moment. "<<printmoney $pubfame.niki.money "red">>. I'm fond of this one. The colours pair well with the rest of the wall.<<if ["red","blue","purple"].includes($pubfame.niki.hair)>> Especially the splash of $pubfame.niki.hair.<</if>> And <span class="gold">it's the last one <<person2>><<he>> did</span>."

You give Niki the money, and <<he>> takes the frame off the wall. <<He>> slides open the cover and hands the photo to you. "The case will be extra. This wood is expensive."
<br><br>

Not waiting for an answer, <<he>> slides a new photo in the frame and hangs it back up on the wall. <<He>> examines it for a moment, then nods and sits back down.

<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
	"Is there any other way I could have it?" you ask. "A less... expensive way?"
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
	You cross your arms. "Any way I could get it without paying out the nose?"
<<else>>
	"Would you accept anything else for it?" you ask.
<</if>>
<br><br>

Niki stares at you for a moment. <<He>> puts a white stick in <<his>> mouth and moves it thoughtfully. "There is a way. If you can replace the photo with one of your own, I won't have a bare spot on the wall. You will, of course, <span class="lewd">need to be naked</span>. I'll still pay you, but it'll be lessened to compensate for the photo."
<br><br>

<<if $photo.model is 1>>
	<<He>> taps <<his>> chin. "I normally don't like doing two shoots in the same week, but I'll make an exception here."

<<if ["exhibitionism","model"].includes($pubfame.target) and $pubfame.goal.includes("Lower")>>
	Modelling to lower your <<fameProse $pubfame.target>> fame sounds counterintuitive, but you're sure 'Mickey' will decrease your image more than this would increase it.
