:: Island Cats Bide
<<effects>>

You wait a moment, watching for anything unusual. Then you sense something behind you. Another <<beasttype 1>> lurks there, hoping to catch you off-guard.
<br><br>

You step to the side, and put your back against a thick trunk. The other <<beasttype 1>> gives up <<bhis 1>> gambit and joins the first. Their ambush failed, but they're not ready to give up.

<<effects>>

You turn to the river and straddle the rope. It looks like it will support your weight, but it hangs close to the water. Your weight will likely push it closer. You'll need to stay on top of it.
<br><br>

Movements from the islanders behind spur you into action. You sit on the rope. It presses into your <<genitals>>, but you endure, and shuffle forward across the river. The islanders stop at the edge, watching you. You can't see their expressions behind their masks, but their body language suggests amusement.

You shuffle along the rope. It's coated in a greasy substance, likely to protect it from the water, but it helps your journey. The bumps in the fibre rub against your <<genitals>> however, and a warmth builds within you.<<garousal>><<arousal 600>>

The islanders on the shore ready their arrows. They are not going to make this easy.
