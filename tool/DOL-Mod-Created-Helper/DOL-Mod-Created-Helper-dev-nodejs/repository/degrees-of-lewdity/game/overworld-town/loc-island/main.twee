This island could be dangerous, but with the beach unsafe, you've no choice but to continue deeper.

The trees thin as the ground becomes steeper, with more and more rocks obstructing your path. You crest a hillock, and get a good view of the surroundings. The sea is visible in all directions, but the island itself is obscured by thick canopy.
<br><br>

A small stream trickles from a rock wall, beneath a sheltered overhang. You're not sure how long you'll be on the island, and this seems like a good home location to orient yourself around.

	You grip harder, with both hands now. And another. And another. The entire ruin seems to light up around you, and you see everything. You hear everything. You are everything. The paths lead nowhere, and the crashing waves of the sea reveal a voiceless mantra of bliss. For a fleeting moment of clarity, you are the presence above, you are the sleeping figure, you are the islander.
	<br><br>

	You are you. And you were born to bear this torch. You open your eyes, and everything returns to normal, leaving behind a sweet emptiness.
<<elseif $fallenangel gte 2>>
	A crushing wave of guilt overtakes you as you grip the hilt. Every doubt you've ever held makes itself painfully known, for a moment that stretches into eternity.
	<br><br>

	You feel as though you're a statue, staring back at your own petrified body as it crumbles across torn eons of nothing. Slowly, though, an alien warmth spreads through you. Someone speaks to you in a language you don't know, yet somehow understand.
	<br><br>

	"Forgive yourself."
	<br><br>

	You feel the hilt lift you. It's weightless, yet heavier than all your doubts, as if to crush them beneath you. For one blissful instant, you feel whole again. It doesn't last nearly long enough, yet the spear seems to promise more. You greedily hold it to your chest.
<<elseif $demon gte 6>>
	The moment you touch the hilt, it sears your palm. Your mind tells you to recoil and withdraw, but your body disobeys. You cling to it, and it clings to you. The pain is unbearable.
	<br><br>

	The impurity within you clashes with the immaculate artifact. It sends swirling shapes into your mind, coalescing into the silhouette of an amourphous, yet humanoid, figure. The only feature you can make out are that it has antlers, with each prong seemingly splitting into an infinite number of further prongs, which each split themselves, growing and vanishing at the base forever. The world spins in a chariot's wheel. The burning builds more and more, but just as quickly, it vanishes. The light no longer burns you, instead feeling comfortably warm.
	<br><br>

	You don't remember wrestling the spear from the sleeping figure's grip, or when you dropped to your knees, but you're holding it as though your life depends on it. Despite being so opposed, so different, you feel as though you need it. And it needs you. You're each a missing piece of each other, a perfect balance.
<<else>>
	A warmth flows from the blade as soon as you grasp the hilt, making you tremble with ecstatic shivers. You lift it, or it lifts you. It feels weightless.

A single, axiomatic thought fills your very being. You will not give up this spear. It is simply how things will be, and nothing will change that.

You brandish the spear, holding it aloft. Sunlight reflects off of the blade, which now shines as if it were new. The crew, and even captain Zephyr, are transfixed by it. Several of them lose their footing, and one falls overboard.
<br><br>

Without wasting the moment you've been granted, you thrust the spear into the hull of Zephyr's ship. The ladder is swallowed by the sea. You then push off the boat with the spear, leaving a sizeable gash behind and granting you the distance you need.

Zephyr finally shakes off the spell. "After <<phim>>!" shouts the captain. "Bring me the spear! We can't lose it now!"

You climb down a spiral staircase. Islanders pass you by, but don't give you a second glance. They don't look particularly different from people in the town, but some wear tattoos of geometric shapes.
<br><br>

You emerge atop a battlement. Beneath is a village of sorts, wooden homes built within the safety of the castle. An intricate scaffold has been erected in the middle. Younger islanders are playing a game nearby, involving a ball and thick sticks.
<br><br>

You leave the battlement and enter a tower, then descend another spiral staircase until you come to a long hallway. Thin windows let in a little light from both directions. A wooden double door waits on the other side.

You push open the doors, revealing a spacious interior. Four <<people>>, a <<person>>, <<person2>><<person>>, <<person3>><<person>> and <<person4>><<person>> sit on rug-covered stools, around a table. They glance at you as you enter without interrupting their conversation. They don't seem concerned by your arrival.
<br><br>

"We do this properly," the <<person1>><<person>> says. "No shortcuts." A hand reaches from beneath <<him>>, and taps <<his>> leg twice. The <<person>> stands, and the "stool" stands as well. The hand pulls off the rug, revealing a <<person5>><<person>>. <<He>> turns to you.
<br><br>
"At last," <<he>> whispers. "My back's sore." <<He>> hands you the rug, and pats your shoulder as <<he>> leaves the room.

The <<person1>><<person>> glances at you, impatient.

"Where was I?" <<he>> says. "Oh yes. The druids are insistent we don't just perform all the rituals one after another."

"I'm not saying we should have more than one ritual," the <<person2>><<person>> says, picking food from between <<his>> teeth. "But there's nothing stopping us tattooing their whole body at once."
<br>
"They'd go mad," the <<person3>><<person>> says. <<He>> grips a gnarled staff with one hand. "Which won't do. The islander wants to talk to them."
<br>
"Talk," the <<person4>><<person>> chuckles. "I say we skip the rituals altogether, and dump them in the pool."

The four break into an argument, talking over each other as they try to get their points across. The <<person3>><<person>> interrupts the fight by slamming <<his>> staff against the ground.
<br><br>

"I think we've forgotten ourselves," <<he>> says. "Let's visit the pools. The runes will remind us who we are."
<br><br>

At once, the other "stools" begin to shuffle towards the door opposite. You follow suit,

<br>
"They're hardly the first to wash up on the shore," the <<person2>><<person>> replies.

You crawl down a ramp, the cobbles giving way to smoother stone. There's a pattern there, but you can't make it out in the dim light.

You hear a door creak open up ahead, and hear the rush of water. The procession enters a tall chamber, the walls covered in what looks like living tree roots. Though on closer inspection, they seem to be carved to give that impression, fused together by some arcane method.
<br><br>

The <<person3>><<person>> raps <<his>> gnarled staff against the ground. The other three stools have arranged themselves in a line, and you join the end, kneeling inches from a pool of water. The surface is still, yet you hear a wet rush somewhere nearby.
<br><br>

"Now see there," the <<person>> says, pointing at a tall statue stood opposite. There are five statues, arranged around the pool in a semi-circle. Runes are carved into its chest, but you can only speak the islander tongue, not read it.
<br><br>

<<person1>>"Get me closer," the <<person>> says, tapping your <<bottom>>. You crawl forward. As soon as your hand touches the edge of the pool, the surface roars into life. A whirlpool manifests in the middle.
<br><br>

The "stools" stand upright, dislodging their riders. "This is impossible," the <<person3>><<person>> shouts, leaning on <<his>> staff. The water rises, until it towers over the statues. The islanders trip over each other in a bid to escape, as the water crashes back down, engulfing you.

You are plunged into darkness.

<br><br>

The step on the <<persons>> back as <<he>> tries to stand, using the high to jump through a high window, tumbling onto grass outside. The young islanders are too focused on their game to notice. You weave between them and the legs of the scaffold, around wooden homes, and dash back into the castle.
<br><br>

You turn left, but more islanders march through a set of double-doors. One hurls a spear, almost striking you in the leg. You escape through another set of doors, then another, then down a smooth slope and into a strange chamber.

Five tall statues greet you, surrounding a central pool. The surface is still, but you hear rushing water somewhere nearby. The walls are covered in wooden decoration, carved to give the impression of living tree roots, fused together by some arcane method.
<br><br>

"In there!" you hear a shout. "Quick! Before <<pshe>> disturbs the monarch!"
<br><br>

You step away from the doors, looking for another exit. As your foot lands on the edge of the pool, the surface roars into life. A whirlpool manifests, then surges upward. The whirling top widens, then swoops down and engulfs you. Helpless, you plunge into darkness.

With a heave and a ho, you push the raft down the beach and board it as it floats onto the water. You paddle toward the entrance of the bay. The tide seems to be on your side, and you're soon sailing away from the island.
<br><br>

The raft plunges you into a wall of mist, and the island behind you vanishes. You paddle, blind, until the distant coast and town are revealed.
<br><br>

The water is good to you, but the raft struggles. The fibres tying the wood together fray and loosen, shrinking the vessel as more wood is lost to the tides. By the time you arrive at shore, you're holding the remainder together with your arms.
<br><br>

You jump from your vessel onto a pier near Mer Street. Cargo delivered, the raft disintegrates behind you.
