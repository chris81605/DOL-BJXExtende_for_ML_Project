A <<generatey2>><<person2>><<person>> leans over the seat behind you. <<person1>>"<<Hes>> not lying. Come look." You're fortunate that none have the daring to assault you further, but the rest of the journey is miserable as they crowd and jeer.

<<generate3>><<person3>>The bus comes to a stop at your destination and the driver climbs out of <<his>> seat. "Everyone away from <<phim>>, now." The students start shuffling off the bus with some reluctance, lingering as long as they can. The driver, a <<person>>, throws you some towels. "I don't ever want to catch you slutting up my bus again. I'm letting the teachers know."

There's not much to do but cover up and leave the bus.
