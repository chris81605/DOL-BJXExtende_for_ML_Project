The ground slopes beneath one of the bramble bushes. You peer into the dark, and see a stone archway. You've read about these old tunnels, but had no idea there would be one hidden in this thicket.

The tunnel is pitch black, but straight, and you're able to make it to the other side without difficulty. You emerge in the forest.
