	As you get ready to put the dough in the oven, <<npc Sam>><<person1>>Sam bursts in. "You didn't start yet, right?" You tell <<him>> that you haven't started making the cream yet. "Good. I need you to make some coffee. I know you don't usually handle that, but we have a couple of foreign aristocrats visiting us."
	<br><br>

	You ask why they would want a drink instead of the buns. "Oh, they're ordering buns too, it's just that… I already promised them you would be handling their entire meal, which also includes the drinks..." <<he>> says apologetically. "I'm sorry to spring this on you so suddenly, but I'm sure you won't have any problems making just a couple of drinks for them."
	<br><br>

	Not seeing many options, you tell <<him>> you'll do it. "Wonderful! Don't worry, there are no expectations for you to be a skilled barista. What matters is that they are made by our star chef."
	<br><br>

	As you get ready to make them coffee, <span class="lewd">a lewd idea strikes you.</span> Perhaps you could add your 'secret ingredient' to it.
