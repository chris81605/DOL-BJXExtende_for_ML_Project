"You get locked out of your flat?" the <<person1>><<person>> asks. They hold a forearm each, and force you against the wall, leaving you unable to cover yourself.

The <<person3>><<person>> and <<person4>><<person>> arrive, and the four stand gawking at your exposed body.

<<effects>>

You endure their probing eyes. The <<person1>><<person>> and <<person2>><<person>> release you just long enough to grasp your hips and spin you to face the wall. They pin you there, pushing your back down and forcing your <<bottom>> up into a vulnerable position.
<br><br>

They take turns groping, squeezing, and giving you the occasional spank. The <<person3>><<person>> steps behind you and grasps your hips, as if <<he>> means to escalate the violation, but further voices down the hall spook all four into fleeing.
<br><br>

You don't know if the newcomers are any better, so you flee as well.

<br><br>

The <<person1>><<person>> seems caught off guard by the boldness of your threat, and <<his>> grip loosens. It's just enough. You twist an arm loose, and give <<him>> an uppercut. The <<person2>><<person>> is quick to react and makes a grab for you, but you turn the <<person1>><<person>> and use <<him>> as a human shield.
<br><br>

You push them both aside and run. You feel their eyes following you, but none of them have the guts to follow you.
