	"Oi," says a voice from an alcove near the steps. Several figures emerge, led by a <<person>> in a ruined mockery of a suit. "There's a toll for passing," <<he>> stares at your face, then looks over your body. "It's <<printmoney 1000>> to enter, but seeing as you're new to the neighbourhood, you get a freebie. Next time, bring some cash."
	<br><br>

	"Or not," <<he>> adds, returning to the alcove. "I'm sure we can find a use for a cute one like you."
	<br><br>

	You walk down the canal, and climb the steps opposite. The flats tower ahead.
