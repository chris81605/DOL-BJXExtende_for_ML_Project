You are on the ground floor of a block of flats on Barb Street. The walls and floor are plain, but clean and well-maintained. Doors line the corridor, and a staircase ascends at the end.

    The flats are silent. The occupants must be asleep.

    A door swings open, and a <<person>> marches through. "I fucking quit!" <<he>> says, throwing a middle finger at the <<person1>><<person>> following behind. <<person2>><<He>> barges past you.
    <br><br>

    "It was just a suggestion," the <<person1>><<person>> says, stopping next to you and leaning on <<his>> thighs. "Well, that's another one," <<he>> says. <<He>> turns to you. "I've seen you around. Doing odd jobs for people in the flats? I'm the superintendent." <<He>> holds out <<his>> hand.

You lead <<him>> straight to the hookah parlour. "Ah," <<he>> says. "I can smell it now. No wonder it's got the people worked up." <<He>> looks around. "That's odd. I thought I passed by here earlier, but I can't imagine failing to notice this."
<br><br>

<<He>> shrugs. "No matter. Here's a little something for the trouble." <<He>> hands you a wad of cash. You've gained <<moneyGain 150>>.
<br><br>

"I'll be paying the owner a visit," <<he>> says, walking away. "Once I've sorted the paperwork."

It takes you a while to find it, but <<he>> follows patiently, until you track it down. "Ah," <<he>> says. "I can smell it now. No wonder it's got people worked up." <<He>> looks around. "That's odd. I thought I passed by here earlier, but I can't imagine failing to notice this."

<<generate1>><<person1>>
You knock on a door. Footsteps thud on the other side, then the door swings open, revealing a <<person>> in a vest and jeans.
<br><br>

<<His>> gaze flicks over your body once. "What do you want?"

:: Flats Knock Intro 2

"Bathroom needs cleaning," <<he>> says, opening the door all the way. "First door on the right. You'll find cleaning materials on the shelf."
<br><br>

<<if $housekeeping gte 100>>
    <<set $flats_progress to 1>>
    You enter the bathroom. It's quite clean already, but the bath is stained. There are several bottles on the shelf, along with a rag. The rag is almost clean as well. You turn the bottles, but find they're completely unmarked. You try to open the closest. The lid is stuck, but you use the rag for extra purchase, and manage to twist it off.
    <br><br>
    You pour the cleaning solution over the bath's surface, and dust the shelves and windowsill while you wait for the chemicals to work. You run the tap, and hose the enamel down with a shower attachment. The chemicals run clear, leaving a pearly white.
    <br><br>
    The <<person>> walks in as you finish up. <span class="green">"Not bad."</span> <<He>> says. "Here's some cash. I'm sure the other residents could use your skilled hands." You make <<moneyGain 10>>.
    <br><br>
    "Wait," <<he>> calls as you leave the flat. "One of the flats has a doorknob fashioned like a lotus flower. <span class="purple">Stay away from it.</span> Not the sort of people in there a nice <<girl>> like you should be getting involved with."
    <br><br>
    <i>You can now work as a cleaner in the flats on Barb Street.</i>
    <br><br>
<<else>>
    You enter the bathroom. It's quite clean already, but the bath is stained. There are several bottles on the shelf, along with a rag. The rag is almost clean as well. You turn the bottles, but find they're completely unmarked. You try to open one, but the lid is stuck. You have more luck with the next, but you've no idea if it's what you need.
    <br><br>
    You pour it into the bath, wait for a few minutes, then run the tap. The water clears, but the stain remains. You try each bottle in turn, but nothing will remove it. You try rubbing the bath with the rag, but to no effect. There's only one bottle left.
    <br><br>
    You twist the lid with all your might. It comes loose, <span class="red">but with too much force.</span> The bottle jerks from your hand, and spills its contents into the bath. It's half empty by the time you get it upright.
    <br><br>
    The <<person>> walks in on this scene. "Shit," <<he>> says. "I gave you a simple fucking-," <<he>> pauses, and inhales. "It's fine. I'm not paying you though. Get out."
    <br><br>
    <span class="blue">You'll need at least an <span class="pink">F+</span> housekeeping skill to work as a cleaner at the flats.</span>
