    You approach the chalets. They sit on a small island of sorts, separated from the mainland by a stretch of sand. The tide is rarely high enough to reach here, and it would take five minutes to cross.
    <br><br>

    A building with a colourful door stands beside a road leading down to the sand. A mass of seagulls sit outside, fighting over a newspaper caked in greasy potato, until the door swings open.
    <br><br>
    "Clear off!" says a <<person1>><<person>>, swinging a broom. The birds take flight in all directions. The <<person>> tuts and sweeps up the torn scraps of paper.

    You approach the chalets and enter the management building. The manager looks up from <<his>> desk.
    <br><br>
    "Ah," <<he>> says. "Changed your mind? Interested in work?"

The <<person>> looks up. "A local?" <<he>> asks, then continues before you can respond. "Interested in work?" <<he>> gestures at the chalets across the expanse of sand.
<br><br>
"It's a nature reserve, but they insist on covering it in rubbish. The tourists, that is. And the gulls. We need someone to brave them both and clean up. You'll get <span class="gold">£10</span> per bag of rubbish on weekdays, and <span class="gold">£15</span> per bag on weekends."
<br><br>
"Should take an hour to fill a bag," <<he>> continues. "You'll have a skeleton key to the chalets, so you can enter as you please. Just say you're there to clean. Interested?"

"Great. Start when you like." <<He>> turns back to the building.
<br><br>
"Oh," <<he>> calls as you leave. "Take care that the holiday makers can get a bit handsy. Just don't give them an excuse, alright? Higher ups turn a blind eye to that sort of thing."

        The manager's head pokes from <<his>> office. "Just a heads up," <<he>> says. "There's a film crew on the stretch of sand between here and the chalets. There often is on weekends. Just be careful when crossing. They might have horses, and who knows what else."
        <br><br>
        <<endevent>>

    You see a cluster of people and vehicles some distance away. It looks like a film crew.

It's hard to walk on such mushy ground.

    You're halfway across when you notice the roar of the ocean growing louder. Then you see it, <span class="red">a freak wave,</span> taller than you, sweeping across the sand.
    <br><br>
    You're unable to escape. It snatches and carries you out to sea.

    A boardwalk emerges from the ground as you near the island, providing a set path. It leads you up a slope, to a collection of chalets surrounded by dunes.
