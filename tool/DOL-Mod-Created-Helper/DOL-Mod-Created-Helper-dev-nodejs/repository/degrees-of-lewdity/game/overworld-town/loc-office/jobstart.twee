You approach the kiosk, and a <<generateNPC 1>><<person1>><<personsimple>> behind the kiosk notices you, standing to <<his>> feet and extending <<his>> hand.
<br>
"Hello there! Come on over, and I'll tell you more about the Office Temp role. You are here about the position, yes?"

You shake your head. The <<personsimple>>'s face turns to a frown.
<br>
"If you aren't interested in working for us, please don't waste my time." <<He>> turns to speak to another applicant.

You nod your head.
<br><br>
"Fantastic! As an Office Temp, you will be dispatched to different floors to provide any assistance you can. This could mean errands like getting coffee, delivering packages, filing papers, or even helping with equipment setup." <<He>> hands you a clipboard with a few forms to fill out.
<br><br>
"Work hours are between <<ampm 6>> and <<ampm 22>>, and pay is <<printmoney 625>> an hour. It may not seem like much, but the clients tend to tip Temps who perform well. Clients on higher floors tend to be more demanding, but they also tend to tip more. You are free to decline any assignment, but we ask that you not make a habit of it. Of course you'll work with us, yes?"

You smile at the <<personsimple>> and take the forms from <<his>> hands.
<br>
"Splendid! Once you get those forms completed, please take them to the office and give them to the manager."
<br><br>
You spend a few minutes filling out the forms for employment and inform the <<personsimple>> once you've finished. <<He>> ushers you past the security desk, towards the office space behind the elevators.

Two rooms flank a long hallway that leads to a door labelled "Manager."  The door swings open, and a well-toned <<personsimple "normal">> in a fitted gray suit emerges to greet you.
<br>
"You must be a new applicant. I'm <<office_manager>>, and I'll be your manager." <<He>> takes the forms from you and leads you to a seat in the office. <<office_manager>> spends a few moments looking over the forms before returning <<his>> attention to you.
<br>
"Everything seems to be in order. I'll finish inputting your information later, but for now, how about a tour?" <<office_manager>> grasps your shoulders and steers you out of the office.

<<office_manager>> leads you to a desk outside of <<his>> office. There is a large touch screen displaying a lot of information.
<br><br>
"This is where you can claim work assignments. You can see the floor and the nature of the task here. Once you accept an assignment, you are to report to your client as soon as possible." <<He>> directs you to the room across from <<his>> office. Inside are other temp workers, who wave and greet you as you walk in. "Please feel free to take a break between assignments here."
<br>
<<office_manager>> walks you back to <<his>> office. "When you are done with an assignment, you can pick up your pay here. You should also let me know if you have any concerns or complaints. I'll go finish filing your paperwork now, but you're free to begin whenever you'd like!"
<br><br>
<<He>> gives you an affirming pat on your shoulders and goes into <<his>> office.

You slide the letter onto the desk. "Bring this to the basement," you say.
<br><br>

The <<personsimple>> looks mildly affronted. "There are procedures for this, you know." <<He>> sighs and puts the letter in a cabinet. "Fine. Now, are you here for the job or not?"
