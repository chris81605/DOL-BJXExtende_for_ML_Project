You go to <<checkfloor>> and speak to the client, a <<generate1>><<person1>><<person>>. <<He>> hands you a list of drink orders.
<br>
"We need these brought back as soon as possible, so please hurry," <<he>> says. You take the list and head back to the lifts.

:: Office Coffee Pond
<<effects>>
Your lift is delayed after stopping at nearly every floor between <<checkfloor>> and the lobby.
<br>
When it finally arrives, you rush towards the coffee shop at the other end of the lobby and accidentally bump into a worker. The worker turns angrily and shoves you into the koi pond!
<br>
The commotion has gathered a small crowd of onlookers, none of whom rush to help you.

You wake up in the security office in the back of the lobby. All of your clothes are missing, and you're wrapped in a towel.
<br><br>
"Looks like you're finally coming to," the guard says, a <<generate1>><<person1>><<person>>. "You were fully nude when we fished you out of the pond; don't really know what happened to your clothes."
<br>
"You somehow killed a few of the fish in the pond, and the higher ups aren't very happy. Lucky for you, we're going to let you off with a warning. Don't swim with the fish again."<<ggsecurity>> <<officeupdatecomplaints 2>>
