	The lifts are close, but the risk of someone seeing you is high.
	<br>
	You could take the stairs, but then you have run across the busy office floor. If you're careful, you should be able to make it to the stairs unseen.
	<br>
	It may be better to find something to cover yourself first, however.

You stay low and shift hiding spots as you make your way towards the stairs.

		A <<generate1>><<person1>><<person>> comes into the aisle you are in and starts walking towards you, so you duck into a nearby supply closet to wait for <<him>> to pass.
		<br>
		You lean against the door, trying to catch your breath when the door violently swings open, knocking you to the floor.
		<br>
		You look up to see the <<person1>><<person>> standing over you with a lustful gaze.

	<<else>>
		You come across a large group of <<people>> blocking the path to the stairs. One of the people starts heading towards you.

		You notice a nearby serving cart covered with a cloth, so you climb into it to hide your <<lewdness>>.
		<br>
		Just when you think the coast is clear, the cart begins moving. A minute later, the cart comes to a halt and you hear someone walk away.

		You dash from your hiding place towards the stairwell, keeping low and staying out of sight. You make it to the door and slip inside unnoticed. The door locks from the inside, so there is no turning back now.
		<br>
		You take a moment to catch your breath. You're going to need it, as you've got <<number $officeFloor>> floors to descend.

You take some time to look around the floor for something to wear.
<br>
<<if $rng gte 80>>
	Someone passes by your hiding place pushing a cart full of towels. You quickly grab one and wrap it around yourself before anyone sees you. You can safely take the lifts now.
