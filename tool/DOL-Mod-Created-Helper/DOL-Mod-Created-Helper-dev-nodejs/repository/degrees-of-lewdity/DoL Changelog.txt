NPCs will try to write degrading things on the PC during non-consensual encounters. What they write is influenced by the different lewd fame stats, combat fame, and beauty.
Pens can be whacked from the NPC's hand when they first pull them out as a bratty action.
NPCs will notice bodywriting during encounters. Different lines have different effects on NPCs who read them:
Lines paired with an arrow pointing at a bodypart will encourage NPCs to fuck you there.

Some lines will make NPCs less inclined to play along with your requests.
Some lines will make NPCs more inclined to violence.
Some lines will make NPCs think the PC more girly or boyish.

Each visible garment and accessory now contributes to your overall appearance, rather than only the one the game deems the most "important". Bulges caused by penises and breasts also contribute, depending on size and coverage. Aroused big penises are hard to conceal. Hair level and physique contribute a little.
Visible genitals still have a big impact on appearance.
Added a gender section to the mirror, which breaks down the factors influencing your appearance. 
You can now adopt a gender posture in front of the mirror, increasing your masculinity or femininity. Effectiveness depends on your English skill.
Improved gyaru skin tones, particularly around a middling tan.
